The Opportunity

Save the Children International has an exciting opportunity for you to join our team as the CHET Project Manager in the UK (London or Remote) or any existing Save the Children International Regional or Country office worldwide.

Role Purpose:

In the immediate aftermath of a disaster or conflict, and throughout the transition from emergency response to recovery and sustainable development, Save the Children’s presence in 120 countries facilitates the rapid delivery of evidence-based and innovative interventions that address the major life-saving and protection needs of the world’s most vulnerable populations. Save the Children’s Centre Humanitarian Technical Team (CHTT) provides technical quality support and strategic direction to programs in humanitarian settings and conducts research, capacity strengthening, and global representation to improve future responses.

This CHET Project Manager will oversee the implementation of efficient and effective systems across the Centre Humanitarian Education Team (CHET), with a focus on supporting rollout and scale up of our Day 1 approach to support integrated rapid response in the first phase of acute emergencies, including a focus on holistic learning and wellbeing outcomes and play. This role is an exciting opportunity for a Project Manager with excellent organisational skills, award management expertise and experience of monitoring & evaluation and an interest in Humanitarian Education to join the SCI Centre Humanitarian Education Team (CHET). Responsibilities will include direct support to Country and Regional Offices rolling out the EiE Day 1 package, including project implementation planning, grant management, financial tracking, coordination of human resources, contractual services, and internal and donor reporting. The post holder will be line managed by the Head of Humanitarian Education and will work with all team members to support the organisation and tracking Day 1 roll out, rapid response scale-up, and other key global EiE initiatives.

Specifically, the post holder will be accountable for (1) project management of EiE Day 1 and other priority global humanitarian education awards and internal collaborative projects; (2) coordination of CHET budgets, cost recovery and action points; (3) tracking of progress against the Save the Children Humanitarian Plan including funding and reach analysis, monitoring of global humanitarian education indicators and support to strengthen reporting systems; (4) supporting knowledge management and learning across the wider Humanitarian Education Team.

In the event of a major humanitarian emergency, the role holder will be expected to work outside the normal role profile and be able to vary working hours accordingly. The role holder will not be expected to deploy to rapid onset humanitarian crisis, but travel might be expected in the course of the responsibilities.

The position will be part of the Centre Humanitarian Technical Team (CHTT) of the Centre Humanitarian Team, but the scope of this role may evolve to work with additional sector teams in the future.
