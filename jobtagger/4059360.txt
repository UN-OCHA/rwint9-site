Project Description: Refugee Legal Aid Program

The Refugee Legal Aid Program provides advice and representation to refugees seeking recognition by UNHCR through refugee status determination procedures in Egypt and assists refugees in accessing resettlement to safe third countries. The Refugee Legal Aid Program is seeking Volunteer Legal Advisors to assist vulnerable refugees in their refugee status determination process.

Current Sudan Context

In light of the recent and ongoing civil war in Sudan, StARS is experiencing a high influx of persons forcibly displaced from Sudan. This includes Sudanese nationals and other nationalities previously displaced from their country of origin to Sudan. StARS remains flexible and reactive to changes in the local asylum-seeking environment as influenced by the Sudan conflict. The Refugee Legal Aid Program is seeking to increase its capacity to provide legal advice and representation in accordance with UNHCR procedures, to best assist those affected by this ongoing conflict.

Role

Each year, the Refugee Legal Aid Program offers several unpaid internships for qualified candidates who can join us for six months. Under the supervision of the Refugee Status Determination Coordinator and Refugee Status Determination Senior Legal Officers, the Refugee Status Determination Volunteer Legal Advisors are responsible for the provision of legal advice and representation to urban refugees in matters related to their Refugee Status Determination procedures with UNHCR Egypt.

Among other responsibilities, Refugee Status Determination Volunteer Legal Advisors conduct Refugee Status Determination workshops to educate refugees about the process in Egypt; accompany clients to refugee status determination interviews at UNHCR; conduct screening interviews with clients seeking assistance appealing the rejection of their refugee status determination claims or seeking to reopen their UNHCR files; represent clients in various refugee status determination procedures, including refugee status determination appeals; and serve as on-call legal advisors, providing information and assistance to clients on a walk-in basis.

Refugee Status Determination Volunteer Legal Advisors are responsible for their own caseloads and get extensive direct experience representing refugees. Following the completion of their six-month commitment, volunteers have gone on to work with UNHCR, IOM, and other international non-governmental organizations.

The Refugee Status Determination Volunteer Legal Advisors are part of RLAP’s team of approximately 20 legal staff and volunteers.
