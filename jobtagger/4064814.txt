Introduction
Child labor remains an endemic problem in sub-Saharan Africa, with the number of children affected reaching 92.2 million in 2020, a significant increase on the 72.1 million in 2016.
The Nigerian government has taken meaningful steps to prioritize child labor elimination by evaluating its previous National Action Plan (2013-2017) and validating a new one (2021-2025) aligned with the ECOWAS Regional Action Plan. Supporting policies, such as the National Social and Behavioral Change Communication Strategy (2021–2023), the revised National Social Protection Policy, and the National Policy on Occupational Safety and Health (2019), have been instituted. Legal efforts include drafting the Labour Standards Bill and anchoring Community Child Labour Monitoring Committees into local child protection structures. Nigeria has also embraced international commitments by becoming a Pathfinder Country of Alliance 8.7 and ratifying ILO Convention 187.
Research has strengthened the knowledge base on child labor in the cocoa and artisanal and small-scale gold mining sectors, including situational analyses on social protection mechanisms and innovative finance. The private sector's compliance capacity has improved through training and tools developed by the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, such as a Code of Conduct, Guidance Tool, and Reporting Template.
However, child labor prevalence remains alarmingly high, with the 2021 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey finding 31% of children aged 5-17 engaged in child labor, 29% in hazardous conditions.
State-level data reveals even higher rates in Niger (42%), Osun (23.2%), and Ondo (8.7%). The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue by pushing more children into work.
Gaps persist in the legal framework, notably the absence of a comprehensive Hazardous Work List detailing prohibited activities for children under 18. Poverty (40% nationally), limited access to legal and social protection (only 11% of the population covered), unemployment, underemployment, informality, lack of decent work opportunities, and low wages all contribute to child labor's prevalence, especially in rural areas.
Sustaining progress requires concerted efforts to address legal gaps, strengthen social protection, promote decent work opportunities, and improve access to essential services. A multipronged approach targeting root causes is crucial for achieving sustainable impact in eliminating child labor in Nigeria. Financial inclusion plays a crucial role in tackling the root causes of child labor by empowering families to escape poverty and achieve economic security. Access to financial services, such as savings accounts, insurance and credit, can help households build assets, invest in their livelihoods and meet their basic needs without resorting to child labor. In addition, the Durban 2022 Call to Action stresses the importance of addressing decent work deficits and income poverty in supply chains to mitigate the risk of child labor.
The latest data (World Bank) on financial inclusion in Nigeria indicates that access to financial services increased from 30% to 45% between 2011 and 2021. But there are still significant challenges, including gender gaps and a heavy reliance on cash payments. In addition, promoting decent work opportunities for adults and young people of legal working age can reduce the pressure on families to resort to child labor.
Nigeria has taken commendable steps to address child labour. However, sustained efforts are needed to achieve lasting impact. Addressing legal framework gaps, expanding social protection, and tackling broader economic challenges are crucial. Continued international collaboration will be vital in supporting Nigeria's efforts to eliminate child labour and ensure a brighter future for its children. Combating child labor requires a multi-faceted approach that goes beyond monitoring and cleaning up workplaces.
Context:
The second phase of the International Labour Organization (ILO) project Accelerating Action for the Elimination of Child Labor in African Supply Chains (ACCEL Africa 2023-2028) has the overall objective of accelerating the elimination of child labor in Africa through targeted actions in selected supply chains in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria and Uganda. In Nigeria the project will focus on the value chain of cocoa and gold.
Nigeria remains the fourth-largest producer of cocoa beans globally and the fifth-largest exporter. A situational analysis of child labour in cocoa farming communities in Ondo State, conducted during the first phase of the Project, found that 98.5 per cent of children surveyed were engaged in cocoa production activities including hazardous work (ILO 2021).
The mining sector in Nigeria is relatively underdeveloped but provides an important source of livelihoods in the country. A value chain analysis of Nigeria’s AGSM sector, conducted during the first phase of the Project, found that children are extensively used in the various aspects of mining activities, including working as miners, transporters, millers, washers, errand boys, vendors, and operators of bellows in smelting (ILO 2022).
To achieve its objective, the project uses an innovative systems-building approach to tackling child labor that moves away from downstream project-based interventions to strengthen existing systems that are essential for tackling the root causes of child labor. The project aims to achieve three outcomes at sub-national, national, regional and global levels:
Policy, legal and institutional frameworks are improved and implemented to combat child labor in global supply chains;
Innovative, evidence-based solutions that address the root causes of child labor in supply chains are institutionalized; and
Strategies to address the root causes of child labor in global supply chains are scaled up through knowledge sharing, partnerships and funding.

At each level, it will target the root causes of child labor, including access to social protection, decent work for adults, improved livelihoods, the transition from school to decent work for young people, and a safe and healthy working environment.
To kickstart the social finance component of the second phase of the ACCEL project and facilitate the implementation of the social finance intervention model in Nigeria, the project is enlisting the expertise of a social finance consultant.
