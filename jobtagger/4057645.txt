1. Background
The Asset and Fleet Management Section provides safe, professional, and cost-effective fleet management services and solutions to support optimum program delivery. We are committed to provide practical guidance to field operations on the operation and management of UNHCR vehicles, support humanitarian civil servants working with UNHCR vehicles and fleet operations, while delivering the Organization’s mandate of providing protection to forcibly displaced and stateless people.
The Asset and Fleet Management Section adapts proactive management approach of UNHCR’s vehicle assets, which may include light vehicles, heavy vehicles, specialist vehicles and motorcycles. Fleet management covers a range of functions, including vehicle procurement and financing, vehicle maintenance, vehicles telematics (tracking and diagnostics), driver and personnel management, speed management, fuel management, and health and road safety management.
The section provides centralized fleet management model to UNHCR, empowering the Organization move beyond simply operating vehicles on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis to actively planning for optimizing vehicle fleet capacity composition and efficiency on a global scale.

Context of Assignment:
UNHCR Smart Fleet is a program of the Asset and Fleet Management Section (AFMS) to optimise the management of vehicle fleets at UNHCR and partner organisations. It includes a range of innovative initiatives to help operations make more effective use of their fleet, ensuring that staff have the transportation they require, while generating savings that can be used to protect people forced to flee. In addition, optimising the use of the UNHCR fleet minimises the number of vehicles that are required and reduces total kilometres driven, helping to green the UNHCR vehicle fleet by reducing carbon emissions. Two key areas of the UNHCR Smart Fleet program through which these goals are achieved are ridesharing and carpooling.
Ridesharing ensures the efficient use of the UNHCR fleet by combining rides between staff members, so that passengers on the same or similar routes travel together in a single vehicle, reducing cost and CO2 emissions. In addition, the introduction of a technology platform modernises booking and dispatch processes, ensures visibility over fleet movements and provides the tools for effective data-driven decision making.
Another key area of UNHCR Smart Fleet is inter-agency carpooling, through which UNHCR operations collaborate with other UN agencies, funds and programs to share fleet, reducing both cost and CO2 emissions. Carpooling allows each participating organisation to maintain a smaller fleet, as they can rely on vehicles from other organisations during peak times. Organisations with large fleets can offset some of the costs of maintaining them by providing rides to passengers from other UN organisations on a cost-recovery basis. For smaller organisations with few or no vehicles, carpooling provides access to secure UN transportation with well-trained and vetted drivers, well-maintained vehicles and, where appropriate, satellite tracking technology to meet the needs of their staff.
As of Mar 2024, ridesharing and carpooling solutions have already been rolled out to 115 UNHCR offices across 21 operations and bureaus with more following every month.
