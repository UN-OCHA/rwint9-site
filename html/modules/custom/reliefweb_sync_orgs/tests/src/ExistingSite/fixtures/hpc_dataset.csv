10992,100% DyD,100% Diversidad y Derechos,Argentina,NGOs,National NGOs/CSOs,https://100porciento.wordpress.com/,"About us
 Those of us who make up the 100% Diversity and Rights group, come together to claim our own diversities, and appealing to build from them, we find ourselves in the idea, commitment and willingness to promote and defend the recognition and respect for the free sexual orientation and identity of gender of all.

 Equality refers to the existence of the diverse, and implies that this not only can not be to the detriment of those who embody it, but that it is characteristic of people as social subjects. Without sexual, gender, ethnic, religious, political or ideological diversity, of nationality, among many others, there is no possible society, or not at least, a society that incorporates the progress in equality achieved by the struggles that make it truly democratic .

 It is not just about wanting or believing in something, we have the conviction that we claim only what corresponds. We join this and every struggle for the recognition, respect and enforceability of the rights of all people, of our rights and those of our fellow men - whoever we are; 100%, all rights for everyone."

The company was co-founded in 1979 by Robert Metcalfe, Howard Charney and others. Bill Krause joined as President in 1981. Metcalfe explained the name 3Com was a contraction of ""Computer Communication Compatibility"",[2] with its focus on Ethernet technology that he had co-invented, which enabled the networking of computers.

 3Com provided network interface controller and switches, routers, wireless access points and controllers, IP voice systems, and intrusion prevention systems. The company was based in Santa Clara, California. From its 2007 acquisition of 100 percent ownership of H3C Technologies Co., Limited (H3C) —initially a joint venture with China-based Huawei Technologies—3Com achieved a market presence in China, and a significant networking market share in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.[citation needed] 3Com products were sold under the brands 3Com, H3C, and TippingPoint."
