ReliefWeb POST API
==================


This module provides a simple POST API to allow partners to submit content.

TODO
----

- [ ] Better authentication
- [ ] Associated user with API key?
- [ ] Use different users to create content instead of system user?
- [ ] Notify poster when content is created?
- [ ] How to give feedback?
      --> Generate UUID, return it when submitting?
      --> Add other endpoint to query status (404, refused, pending, published?)
- [ ] Limit the content types the provider can post
- [ ] Limit the fields the provider can populate
- [ ] Validate report original publication date so it cannot be in the future?
- [ ] Use a custom fiedable entity for the providers?
