ReliefWeb - DSR module
======================

This module provides integration with the Digital Situation Report API.

## Client

This module provides a client to perform request against the DSR API via the [reliefweb_dsa.client](src/Services/DSRClient) service.

## Settings

The [module configuration](config/install/reliefweb_dsr.settings.yml) should be overridden as needed in the `settings.php` to be able to communicate with the DSR API site.
