ReliefWeb Autocomplete
======================

This component provides styling for autocomplete widgets.

Note
----

While trying to be library agnostic, the current styling is tied to the
`simpleautocomplete.js` library, notably in regards to the class names.

Todo
----

Remove unnecessary things from the icon sprite and see if we can use the
css variables for the colors.
