ReliefWeb Subscriptions
=======================

This component provides styling for the subscription emails and their preview.

**Important:** Selectors can only be single classes.

Note: due to the limited support of styles in emails, the css rules are for single classes and contain only basic rules. Those are inlined in the emails.
