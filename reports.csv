He intended to disprove with facts the traditional but ineffective methods, as most farmers used to apply urea only once during the crop growing season. “I looked after my wheat crops very carefully, but they were very often too weak,” says Pak Rahman, one of the 37,200 farmers who have attended this same training organized by FAO in 16 provinces across Afghanistan.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The unveiled secret: how much and when you should use urea</strong></p><p id="""">Pak Rahman did not know how to correctly apply urea in order to build the solid ‘foundations’ for wheat crops to grow properly.

I immediately put this advice into practice for this cropping season and my crops are growing healthier, greener, and stronger,” admits the Afghan farmer.</p><p id="""">When urea is correctly applied throughout the cropping cycle, including seed sowing, tillering, and heading stages, it contributes to strengthening wheat crops so to better withstand pests and crop diseases, as well as heavy rains or high winds – another important lesson learnt for Pak Rahman, who had often struggled with these issues. He believes that “anyone who actively participated in the technical training will see big positive changes in their wheat production”.</p><p id="""">“The villagers are satisfied because they have seen tremendous ‘greenery’ and remarkable differences in their wheat cultivation this season,” says Abdul.</p><p id="""">The training was conducted by Future Generations Afghanistan (FGA), FAO’s implementing partner, as part of a more comprehensive and time-critical assistance project.

As reported by the 2020 Seasonal Food Security Assessment, over 90 per cent of farmers cannot buy certified seeds. They are either too expensive or simply not locally available.</p><p id="""">“I had no intention of cultivating wheat for the next season because I knew I couldn’t afford the costs of buying certified seeds from the market,” says Rahimullah, a farmer from Paktika province. </p><p id="""">Rahimullah’s family has endured hardship and hasn’t been able to yield anything from their agricultural land. One cow was their only means of livelihood. As many other vulnerable farming families, they lacked the knowledge as well as the necessary amount of quality seeds and fertilizers to get started.</p><p id="""">Like Rahimullah or Pak Rahman, all the participants received a wheat cultivation package, which consists of 50 kg of certified wheat seeds, 50 kg of diammonium phosphate fertilizer, and 50 kg of urea fertilizer. “This package has made it possible for me to grow wheat. I am more than happy with this time-critical emergency assistance,” says Rahimullah.</p><p id="""">This support has reached the most vulnerable farmers in remote rural areas in Laghman province.

<p id="""">Before the conflict in Yemen started in 2015, Ahmed attended primary school in his hometown in Al Hodeida Governorate. But his school was hit by an airstrike, which sadly prevented Ahmed from going to school. And when the fighting intensified, his family fled to a village in Mokha district in Ta’iz governorate.</p>
<p id="""">Ahmed was hopeful that he could soon return to school and normal life in the village but realized that the local school, Al-Zuhari, was also destroyed due to the conflict. Children were being taught at a nearby clinic and when there were too many students to fit inside the clinic, they sat outdoors near the destroyed school building.</p>
<p id="""">But Ahmed still wanted to learn, so he started attending classes.</p>
<p id="""">Learning in the clinic was far from ideal. “We did not have blackboards or chairs to sit on, and there were few teachers who volunteered to teach us,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p id="""">The teachers were using the doors of the clinic to write lessons on. There were no school desks or chairs and Ahmed and the other children had to sit on the ground with no pen or paper, with only a handful of mostly unpaid teachers to run the school.</p>
<p id="""">Many children in Mokha District share Ahmed’s troubles. The district was badly affected by the conflict, leaving many schools either partially or fully destroyed. Civilians were killed, homes attacked, and health centers closed.</p>
<p id="""">Bu at least the area near Al-Zuhari school was safe. Seven-year- old Nagat also attends classes there. She is from the area, but her family had to flee the fighting temporarily—only to return and find their school and much of the village destroyed.</p>
<p id="""">Her father is unemployed and could not afford transport to send her to another school with better facilities.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, the Norwegian Refugee Council worked with people in Mokha district to prioritize improving the schools. They fixed school latrines, gave students and teachers supplies, and constructed new classrooms to run on solar power. Volunteer teachers received supplies, training, and some financial support.</p>
<p id="""">Ahmed now feels happier about continuing his studies. After all the struggles and years of uncertainty, Ahmed, Nagat and their classmates now have a chance to learn again.</p>
<p id="""">The Yemen Humanitarian Fund supported the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) to implement a $1.1 million project providing emergency education and WASH assistance to some 15,000 people affected by conflict in Ta’iz Governorate.</p>

Armed with gloves and rakes, they spread across the camp, collecting plastic bags and other litter strewn about the shelters.
<p id="""">Another group is cutting down overgrown bushes and shrubs in another section of the camp. They are part of the Cash-for-Work program started by Northern Frontier Youth League-NoFYL and funded by the Somalia Humanitarian Fund. The project improved conditions in the displacement site while providing cash transfers to vulnerable community members.</p>
<p id="""">Among them are two women - Xamaro Qoriyow, 60, and Simaan Ismacil, 41, - who combined their monthly stipends and started a joint retail business that has become a success.</p>
<p id="""">“I have always wanted to start a business to support my family, but this was impossible because I did not have money. I lived in debt and had no support except from my neighbors. Sometimes we skipped some meals,” said Xamaro, a widow raising ten children (7 girls and 3 boys).</p>
<p id="""">Simaan initially suggested the novel idea of combining the monthly stipend to start a business.</p>
<p id="""">“I spoke to several women participating in the camp cleaning exercise, but only Xamaro accepted my idea. We agreed to put aside some money every month so that we could start a business.”  Over the next three months, the two women saved enough money from the monthly incentive to start a small retail shop in Beled-Amin site. They can now make a decent living for their families.</p>
<p id="""">“Can you believe we saved money for three months, and now we have our own business?” asked Xamaro. “Thanks to the cash for work program, I am living my dream of owning a business. We sell everything: food items, clothes, shoes, soaps and liquid shampoo. If we had space here, we would bring camels here and sell them!” she laughed. “Our family’s needs are now covered, and I don’t depend on people for assistance anymore.”</p>
<p id="""">To supplement their income, the two women bought solar battery chargers and set up a mobile charging system in their shop where people charge their mobile phones at a small price of $0.1. In a day, they can charge up to 50 mobile phones. This helps them pay rent for the shop and cover daily food costs and other basic needs. They are now planning to expand their business and sell fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Ethiopia, Shire. </strong>“I was in the middle of teaching my class when we heard gunshots and explosions. I had to calm myself down and make sure all my students were safe,” recalls Semira*, a former teacher who fled the conflict in Tigray.</p>
<p id="""">A mother of four children, ‘Teacher Semira’ as she is known, shared her story. “We walked for five days to reach Shire, in search of safety. When we arrived, the host community was welcoming and provided us with some  injera (traditional flatbread) and water, among other things. However, we had to sleep under trees for the first few days as we had no shelter – I feared for our safety all the time.”</p>
<p id="""">With CERF funding, IOM, alongside other partners, provided Semira’s family and others like hers with shelter, basic household items and other support crucial for their survival. Despite the drastic changes to her family’s situation, she refuses to dwell on their difficulties. “I am grateful for this shelter, for everything. Life has not been easy since we left, but I’ve learned not to take anything for granted.”</p>
<p id="""">Public buildings, including schools, across the Tigray region have served as emergency housing for people as they fled the conflict. At the height of the conflict access to the region was limited, but by mid-April IOM’s Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) team were able to initiate camp management activities.</p>
<p id="""">Thanks to these efforts, families like Semira’s no longer need to sleep out in the open. While they wait until it is safe to return home, they can rest more peacefully with, at the very least, a makeshift roof over their heads.</p>

report,draft,0,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"Anticipatory action in Ethiopia and Somalia","<p id="""">April 16,  2021</p>
<p id=""""><strong><em>Ethiopia and Somalia. </em></strong>The humanitarian impacts of drought often build up slowly but surely, growing into a devastating crisis that is frequently recognized much too late, even though the warning signs have been there for months.</p>
<p id="""">Since late 2020, delayed and erratic rainfall has affected many parts of Ethiopia and Somalia, resulting in devastating water shortages, including drought conditions in some locations, with widely depleted water reservoirs and loss of pasture and livestock. Simultaneously, the combined impact of locusts, COVID-19, floods and conflict has severely eroded the coping capacity of Ethiopians and Somalis.</p>
<p id="""">An even worse crisis is looming: Several climate forecasts predicted a poor March-June rainfall season and early observations are starting to confirm this. As a result, in Somalia, up to 2.65 million people (21.5 per cent of the population) are projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC 3 and above) between April and June. In Ethiopia, drought is also projected to drive 12.9 million people into severe levels of food insecurity by the end of June.</p>
<p id="""">“Hunger and deaths begin long before the highest levels of food insecurity. We must anticipate and act now,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a id="""" href=""https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2021-03-11/secretary-generals-briefing-the-security-council-conflict-and-food-security-bilingual-delivered-please-scroll-down-for-all-english-and-all-french-versions"">has warned</a>.</p>
<p id="""">To avoid the worst impacts, UN agencies and our partners in both countries are currently implementing anticipatory actions with $40 million in CERF support ($20 million per country). Activities focus on mitigating loss of livelihoods and declines in food consumption, ensuring continued access to water, preventing school dropouts, timely detection and control of disease outbreaks and mitigating protection risks.</p>
<p id="""">Anticipatory action is an innovative approach to humanitarian response, taken to prevent or mitigate potential impacts before the shock of a disaster, or before acute impacts are felt by communities, and based on predictions of how the event will unfold. Working like this leads to a faster, more efficient and more dignified provision of aid, which can also protect hard-won development gains.</p>
<p id="""">This anticipatory approach, which includes pre-agreed trigger thresholds, pre-arranged finance and activities is possible thanks to the collaborative pilot effort among humanitarian partners, together with government bodies and global experts, under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinators in these two countries and facilitated by OCHA.</p>
<p id="""">For Somalia, this is the second activation of the anticipatory action pilot. A <a id="""" href=""https://www.unocha.org/story/un-humanitarian-chief-release-140m-cerf-funds-anticipatory-action-projects"">first activation</a> in June 2020 demonstrated how collective anticipatory action at scale can work, leading to a faster, cheaper and more effective response. For example, we found that an early health intervention reduced disease outbreaks and that the anticipatory rehabilitation and upgrading of boreholes has improved household finances, strengthened mental health, kept livestock healthier, reduced disputes related to water sources, and mitigated displacement.</p>
<p id="""">The anticipatory action this year in Somalia will be complemented with a $13 million allocation from the <a id="""" href=""https://www.unocha.org/somalia/shf"">Somalia Humanitarian Fund</a> and a $7 million CERF rapid response allocation to address the impacts of the severe water shortages and drought conditions.</p>
<p id="""">The anticipatory action allocation in Ethiopia this year will be going to <em id="""">woredas</em> in Afar; Oromia; Somali; and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ (SNNP) regions, where drought is the main driver of food insecurity.</p>
<p id="""">CERF is one of the fastest and most effective ways to help people affected by crises. Since its creation, it has assisted hundreds of millions of people, with over $7 billion allocated across more than 100 countries and territories.</p>
<p id="""">None of this would be possible without the generous and consistent support of our donors.</p>
<p id="""">Further details on agencies and assistance can be found on the CERF website – see <a id="""" href=""https://cerf.un.org/what-we-do/allocation/2021/summary/20-RR-ETH-46461"">Ethiopia</a> and <a id="""" href=""https://cerf.un.org/what-we-do/allocation/2021/summary/21-RR-SOM-47081"">Somalia</a>.</p>

<p id=""""><strong><em>Bangladesh. </em></strong>Anticipatory action — helping people before disaster strikes — saves lives and resources. Mobilizing early also allows people to prepare with dignity and on their own terms.</p>
<p id="""">On 4 July 2021, a high probability of severe flooding was forecast for mid-July along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh, with one-third of the area’s total population likely to be affected. CERF released a $5.2 million emergency grant to UN agencies in Bangladesh to help people prepare.</p>
<p id="""">With CERF support, UNFPA distributed a dignity kit that included hygiene, menstrual and reproductive health supplies to over 15,000 people in Bogura, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Jamalpur, and Sirajgonj districts. Kits were tailored to meet the needs of women, girls, and Hijra, members of Bangladesh’s transgender community.</p>
<p id="""">Since 2013, Bangladesh has recognized the Hijra community as a third gender. However, many continue to suffer due to misconceptions, harmful superstitions, and increased economic vulnerability — which COVID-19 has only exacerbated.</p>
<p id="""">Kajli was one of the people who received a dignity kit prior to the predicted floods. “I am so happy to see these arrangements for us. After the pandemic, we were scattered about, and we don’t have any income. I don’t even have a proper place to live at the moment, and the place where I am staying could go underwater any minute.”</p>
<p id="""">CERF’s anticipatory funding helped Kajli and thousands of others better prepare for the floods in July.</p>

<p>Sudan | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Sudan, Gedaref.</strong> Three women displaced from Omdurman, in Sudan’s Khartoum State, wait for their turn in a room at Gedaref City Municipality, which the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) is using as a cash assistance distribution point. </p>



<p>The women show their identification to NRC staff, sign some required forms and receive 177,100 Sudanese pounds (US$275), provided by NRC, with funding from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>One woman said: “I will buy cooking pots, plates, cups and some mats for my family with this money.” Another said she would fix the roof of her family's and buy some shades. </p>



<p>The third woman was there to receive the money on behalf of her family, as her father and mother are elderly and could not come. She said they would buy mats, plastic sheeting, cooking supplies and charcoal. She added: “We are a large family, my father, mother, brother and sisters, and their children. We will make more space for us by putting up some poles and covering them with plastic sheets to protect us from the sun.”</p>



<p>Since fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces erupted in April, about 4.9 million people have been displaced in Sudan, according to the International Organization for Migration. These internally displaced people  have sought refuge in about 5,200 locations across all of Sudan’s 18 states. While those displaced are from eight states, the majority — about 3.3 million people (68 per cent ) — are originally from Khartoum. About 511,200 of the newly displaced people are in the eastern states of Gedaref, Kassala and Red Sea.</p>



<p>Muhammed Abdlqayum, NRC’s Shelter Team Leader for eastern Sudan, explained: “We are targeting 400 families [an estimated 2,400 people] in two localities in Gedaref State, Ar Rahad and Madinat [Baladia]. This $550 cash assistance is distributed in two rounds; after we complete this first round of distribution, there will be another post-distribution round after 30 days...and then we provide the second installment.”</p>



<p>NRC decided to use cash for NFIs and shelter assistance because it is more effective, faster, and easier to control and meet people’s needs. Distributing in-kind supplies would require importing those items from overseas, as Sudan’s production and supply chains are disrupted by the conflict. NRC officials explained that this would be a lengthy and more expensive process. </p>



<p>Phyllis Wanja, an Area Support Manager in eastern Sudan, explained “With cash assistance, the people we are aiming to support, especially with multi-purpose cash, can get what they actually need and based on what their priorities are,” she said.</p>

<p><strong>Burkina Faso.</strong> In northern Burkina Faso, Rakiéta Sanfo struggled to meet her family’s most immediate needs due to the conflict. She had lost access to her land and her animals when she fled her home for a safer place.</p>



<p>Prolonged violence and insecurity have displaced millions of people across Burkina Faso, where over 10% of the population is now internally displaced. This crisis remains one of the most neglected humanitarian emergencies in the world.</p>



<p>United Nations OCHA-managed Pooled Funds are aiding local and international humanitarian organizations to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable people and bolster food security for the future.</p>



<p>In Burkina Faso, support from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) helped OCHA partner FAO assist over 3,000 displaced and host families in the Sahel region, by preserving and supporting their livelihoods through diversifying diet and sources of income.</p>



<p>Rakiéta received a rooster and ten hens, providing her family with a source of animal protein to improve their nutrition and allowing her to sell the eggs to generate income for other basic needs.</p>



<p>The project also includes training in animal health and market gardening techniques to help small-scale producers like Rakieta keep their animals and crops healthy.</p>

<p>oPt, Gaza. Qais, who is twelve years old, was out playing with friends earlier this year. They found a strange object and tried to open it. Then, the explosion happened.</p>



<p>Two friends died and fifteen were injured, including Qais. Shrapnel struck his back, neck and arms.</p>



<p>Unexploded remnants of war, like the one Qais encountered, are just one of the lethal hazards people face every day in Gaza. For Qais, it wasn’t even safe to play.</p>



<p>One year into this catastrophic crisis, over 40,000 people have been killed. And, as bombardment continues from the air and land, <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-221-gaza-strip-enhe"">people continue to suffer, and survive, in unimaginably difficult circumstances.</a> &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly two million people have fled their homes since October of last year – many of them have been displaced multiple times, as nowhere is safe.</p>



<p>Flexible funding from donors allows critical resources to be deployed quickly, flexibly<br>and in a coordinated manner – when and where they are most needed. The collective support and trust of humanitarian donors results in effective, relevant action.</p>



<p>Rapid and targeted allocations from the OCHA-managed pooled funds over the past year have allowed international and local partners to respond to people’s immediate needs as well as adapt to the situation as it evolved.</p>



<p>Since 7 October 2023, the <a href=""https://www.ochaopt.org/page/opt-humanitarian-fund/about-opt-humanitarian-fund"">occupied Palestinian Territories Humanitarian Fund</a> has disbursed over $95 million through Palestinian and international organizations on the front line and helped nearly 2.5 million people.</p>



<p>The Central Emergency Response Fund allocated $18.7 million last October to kick-start and scale up humanitarian operations.</p>



<p>And working together, through complementary allocations, the Pooled Funds have leveraged their unique strengths: with the oPt HF supporting frontline local responders, while CERF has focused on ensuring swift responses by UN agencies.</p>



<p><em>Hot meals, food and water</em></p>



<p>Palestinian organization <em>Anera</em> is providing families with daily hot food <a href=""https://www.anera.org/blog/gaza-and-west-bank-response-log/"">across Gaza through community-run kitchens</a>. People can come to these places every day for a warm meal.</p>



<p>Some people are unable to or don’t feel safe enough to leave their shelters to get food. That’s why food deliveries are equally important.</p>



<p>With oPt HF support <em>Oxfam</em> delivers food parcels and vegetable baskets to vulnerable households in northern Gaza, whose residents couldn’t otherwise easily get to the market.</p>



<p>Similarly, <em>Premiere Urgence International</em> and their Palestinian partner <em>PARC</em> are focused on reaching families living outside collective shelters – either with relatives or in informal shelters - who might otherwise miss out on larger distributions.</p>



<p>Local organization Ma’an, with funding from the oPt Humanitarian Fund, is also distributing water in mobile tankers to displaced people. Ma’an says this work is “one of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MAANDevelopmentCenter/posts/pfbid0eGbEmWjuvR9pmEynk5sVjTY6XJXhmx4HRxsUrnWLqhaik1pVmRu4JzKTs3TB3wudl?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZVCDB1g6BINdQWtGNdcjUprV5DAjpWDqnx8-cS4UEPWoePvIRcOhZGESlJAbDnfV22e94IuHg0ejLqioOpoHHqqVJue7u9mYmBKYPK3DPe1ykzF-EiGuVM5IHSlT7bLBX_FoGS4ylrkdZGlcs5PxKbam1w_nTHQC2zeTeYJ8pVJjiO4gk6lDjUNPL-34bxO7rw&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"">the most important activities we continue in the Strip.”</a></p>



<p><em>A safe place to play and education on dangers</em></p>



<p>Special activities give children a chance to play and express their feelings in a safe space. <em>Terre des Hommes</em> is conducting events in displacement sites that <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=935164238655327&amp;id=100064852771728&amp;paipv=0&amp;eav=AfZU-Us_H4RONx4XymmoyvKviWpqkorQfpayD90UsIS8Q9sphDYudzfvH19o46l2T7I&amp;_rdr"">provide mental health and psychosocial support for children living through war.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, at the ‘Together Center’, <em>Ma’an Development Center</em>, another Palestinian organization, provides psychological first aid, counselling, and explosive hazards workshops.</p>



<p>Unexploded remnants of war, like the one Qais encountered, are just one of the risks of daily life in Gaza. It’s too dangerous to play outside. But with support from <em>Humanity &amp; Inclusion</em>, Qais is recovering, and wants to help other children avoid what he went through.</p>



<p>In July, he took part in a workshop to raise awareness about the risk of unexploded remnants of war for young people. “If you see something, move away and tell someone,” Qais advises other children. “Don’t underestimate the risk.”</p>



<p><em>Shelter and sanitation for people on the move </em><em></em></p>



<p>Eman was sheltering in a school in Rafah with her children. Conditions were really difficult. ""I have to wait two hours to use the bathroom; the line is very long, and there are lots of people in the shelter,” she explained.</p>



<p>With millions of people on the move and living in informal shelters, addressing water and sanitation needs is absolutely critical.</p>



<p>With funding from CERF and other donors, <em>UNICEF</em> is providing affected families in Rafah and in other displacement sites with emergency water trucking and mobile latrines. In Khan Younis, oPt HF supported <em>WeWorld</em> community cleaning campaigns, including trash collection and disposal at displacement sites to help establish safer living conditions.</p>



<p>UNICEF has also <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/sop/stories/children-face-severe-water-shortages-and-dire-hygiene-situation-gaza-strip"">provided people displaced by the fighting with basic shelter supplies.</a> &nbsp;</p>



<p>Mays, who is 13, lives in a makeshift tent near an UNRWA shelter. Her family received some basic supplies through these UNICEF distributions.</p>



<p>But that support, while critical, can’t fix the terrible reality that her sisters have been killed and her home destroyed.</p>



<p>“I am so tired. I cannot handle this anymore. I need it to end,” says Mays.</p>

report,published,1,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"Emergency assistance following the earthquake in Haiti","August 16,  2021

UN agencies and partners are mobilizing resources and personnel and supporting the Government of Haiti with assessments and relief response following the earthquake that hit Haiti over the weekend.

On 15 August Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths allocated US$8 million from the <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/"">UN Central Emergency Response Fund</a> to support the humanitarian response. The allocation will provide essentials such as health care, clean water, emergency shelter and sanitation for people affected by the disaster.

Access to the southern peninsula – where the 7.2-magnitude earthquake hit – is challenging due to gangs controlling movements. Local authorities are negotiating access, and an initial convoy of six vehicles with staff from UN agencies and the Government travelled to the affected area yesterday, 15 August. Further convoys carrying supplies will travel today.

Staff from the <a href=""https://www.unocha.org/our-work/coordination/un-disaster-assessment-and-coordination-undac"">UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination</a> teams are also arriving in country to support coordination and assessments.

As of yesterday evening (15 August), the death toll had risen to 1,297 killed and more than 5,700 injured, according to Haiti’s Civil Protection Department.

The health system in affected areas is being overwhelmed, as health workers are assisting the injured while also contending with the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 patients is expected to increase in the coming days and weeks.

While assessments are still in their early stages, more than 13,000 homes have been destroyed and more than 13,000 have sustained damages. These figures are likely to increase significantly in the coming hours.

The latest earthquake, similar in magnitude to the quake that devastated the country in 2010 and left hundreds of thousands of people dead and displaced, has toppled churches and schools, and severely curtailed electricity in the affected areas.

Tropical Storm Grace is expected to pass over Haiti tomorrow (17 August), bringing heavy rainfall that could lead to flash floods and mudslides.

<p id=""""><strong>Afghanistan, near Kabul.</strong> In one remote village outside Kabul, CARE, an Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund partner, is the only organization providing health services – including medicine, maternal health, and nutrition – through its weekly mobile clinics.</p>
<p id="""">In many areas, mobile clinics like this one are the only healthcare option. ""Each time I come here, I see between 100 and 150 patients in a day,"" says a CARE physician. ""Flu, cough, and other winter-related diseases, like lung problems, and diarrhea, are the most common problems in this village. Women and children are the most vulnerable and are in dire need. There are no physical health centers here.""</p>
<p id="""">The escalating crisis in Afghanistan devastated an already overburdened health system in 2021. The Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) supported mobile clinics like CARE's. At the same time, funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) bolstered the broader health system of the country.</p>
<p id="""">CERF allocated $45 million – the year's largest allocation–to prevent the country's health system collapse. The funding enabled the World Health Organization and UNICEF – partnering with national and international NGOs – to keep healthcare facilities operating until the end of the year, including hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p id="""">""One of the biggest challenges of the recent crisis here in Afghanistan has been the lack of medical supplies and equipment, and WHO in the last couple of weeks has brought in close to 140 metric tonnes of urgently needed supplies, including these essential health kits for hospitals and clinics, the trauma kits, which provide supplies for 50 trauma patients and up to 100 surgical procedures,"" said Dr. Rick Brennan of the WHO.</p>
<p id="""">Overall CERF funding enabled WHO and UNICEF to support 2,168 facilities across 31 provinces between November 2021 and January 2022, preventing a humanitarian catastrophe caused by the collapse of the national public health system.</p>
<p id="""">At the same time, the AHF disbursed $12.6 million to support NGO mobile health services in 16 provinces, particularly those providing trauma care, mental health, psychosocial support, and other services outside of the Government's Basic Package of Health Service.</p>
<p id="""">Mobile clinics like CARE's were able to bring vital nutrition assistance to people, especially mothers and children.</p>
<p id="""">""I have two children, Shahnaz, 3, and Razia, 2, and they have both suffered from malnutrition since they were born. We haven't been able to take care of them properly because we can't afford it. Since CARE started helping us with nutrition packages, my children's health condition has improved. If CARE hadn't helped us, their health would have kept getting worse,"" said one mother.</p>
<p id="""">The mobile health teams also provide mental healthcare, a benefit for women who may not otherwise have access to such services. Healthnet TPO-run clinics provided counseling, medication and follow-up care for a woman suffering trauma after her husband's death. Elsewhere, IMC-supported clinics provided counseling on coping strategies and follow-up care for women experiencing symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety.</p>
<p id="""">As CERF-supported projects propped up the collapsing national public health care system, the AHF expanded trauma care and other health services to underserved areas. Together, the Funds ensured a comprehensive coverage of critical health needs, with broad geographic coverage, during a tumultuous time in Afghanistan.</p>

<p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Syria, Homs</strong>. “Our difficult situation makes me sad and frustrated, but I try to stay strong for my grandchildren,” says Inas (not her real name), a 56-year-old woman from Syria and breadwinner for her family since her husband’s death. Inas’ family includes her two daughters and three grandchildren, the children of Inas’ son, who has been missing for nine years.</p>
<p id="""">“Despite my old age, I do any work I can find to secure the necessities of life,” Inas continues. “I cut vegetables and sell them to the neighbors. My daughters and I work for daily wages picking olives and tomatoes. Sometimes, my daughters and I sleep with no food so that the kids can eat.”</p>
<p id="""">The conflict and prolonged crisis in Syria and the COVID-19 pandemic have heavily affected thousands of vulnerable families. In 2022, nearly 14 million people, or 64 per cent of the people, will be food insecure.</p>
<p id="""">In this difficult environment, humanitarian partners provide life-saving and sustainable assistance to strengthen community resilience.</p>
<p id="""">The Food and Livelihood Assistance for Syrian Households, or FLASH, project, supported by the Syria Humanitarian Fund (SHF) in cooperation with the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), an international NGO, provides monthly food vouchers equivalent to US$64 to vulnerable households for six months.</p>
<p id="""">This support is vital for Inas’ family, and others like hers. The project reached 658 families, or 3,290 people, of whom 85 per cent were women and 15 per cent were living with disability. An additional 75 families received agriculture and livestock-based livelihood assistance.</p>
<p id="""">“When I received the voucher, I was so happy that I cried because now I can get a break from spending all our money on food, can be relieved from some of our accumulated debt, and maybe even save some money. The voucher provides healthy food for my grandchildren. We can even buy things we haven’t eaten [in a long time] such as legumes, halawa, and cheese.”</p>
<p id="""">The project focused on families in the Telbisa area of Homs Governorate, which was heavily damaged by the conflict, including damage to basic infrastructure, housing and farming land.</p>
<p id="""">People have been slowly returning to the area since it became accessible to humanitarian organizations in 2018. Though it is an agricultural area, food insecurity is high, mostly because of limited livelihood opportunities and widespread poverty, with high levels of disability. Approximately 72 per cent of people surveyed in September 2020 (ADRA Syria, baseline assessment), reported that there were months they did not have enough food to meet their family needs.</p>
<p id="""">“Now, I no longer need to borrow money, and my grandchildren are happy that they can have delicious and healthy food at the same time,” said Inas.</p>

When war erupted, and the conflict escalated, many families suffered, losing their jobs and becoming displaced. I moved with my family from another district near relatives in search of safety.”</p>
<p id="""">As a result of their displacement, Ibtisam’s parents married her to a cousin ten years older than her. Ibtisam was forced to leave school and soon became pregnant. “When circumstances became stable enough, my parents moved back to our old house, leaving me alone with my husband, who started to mistreat me and attempted to end the pregnancy.”</p>
<p id="""">Ibtisam reached out to a UNFPA-supported safe space, where she accessed psychological support and health care, and was referred to a safe shelter.Ibtisam explains: “I did not want to go. Instead, the safe space contacted my parents and provided me with a case manager to accompany me on my move home.”</p>
<p id="""">UNFPA helped Ibtisam – and other girls in her situation – to prepare for the birth of her first child. Ibtisam also took part in a vocational training programme where she learned tailoring. She then went on to became a trainer, teaching other women the new skills she had acquired.</p>
<p id="""">At a UNFPA-supported hospital, Ibtisam delivered her baby via emergency Caesarean and, with help from a lawyer provided by UNFPA, she was granted a divorce and monthly child support.</p>

<strong id="""">Iraq, Mosul<em id="""">.</em></strong> Hamid is 30 years old. He used to live with his family in a village outside of Mosul before fighting started. The family had their own house and sheep, that provided a good income. When airstrikes destroyed their house in 2017, Hamid and his family fled their village. They stayed in Jada’a camp for a year and a half before returning to Mosul.
<p id="""">After losing their house and animals to the conflict, Hamid and his family had to start from zero to rebuild their life. Upon returning to Mosul, they rented a house. Without a stable income, they could not afford to buy furniture and even buying food and other basic items became a struggle. In October 2020, during a moment of frustration, Hamid slammed a door, causing severe damage to his spinal cord, paralyzing him from the neck down.</p>
<p id="""">‘’I did not attempt to hurt myself, but the accident happened in a second and the result was unexpected,” says Hamid. “After the accident, I faced more difficulties, both physically and psychologically. Even though I was surrounded by family and friends who supported me, I felt alone alone...due to my disability.’’</p>
<p id="""">Handicap International (HI), an international NGO partner of the Iraq Humanitarian Fund, received $343,258.70 through the Fund’s 2021 first Standard Allocation to implement a health and protection project to provide physical therapy and mental health services to disabled returnees, displaced people and community members, as well as their caregivers, in Mosul.</p>
<p id="""">When visiting Bab el Baith primary health care centre (PHCC), Hamid’s brother noticed a signboard about HI’s services provided in the centre and told Hamid. The PHCC then referred Hamid directly to HI, which provided eight physiotherapy and MHPSS sessions at his home. HI also supported Hamid’s brother, who is his caregiver, by demonstrating movements he can practice with Hamid to continue his physiotherapy.</p>
<p id="""">Hamid now feels more optimistic and his physical condition continues to improve. Hamid says: ‘’My mental health improved after receiving the psychosocial support. I sleep better, eat better, and I’m more motivated to do my physiotherapy sessions by myself because I can see the difference it is making to my life. For example, a few months ago, I could not move my hands, but after receiving physiotherapy sessions, I feel much better and am able to use my hand for my daily needs. Therefore, I always encourage people to seek psychosocial support.’’</p>
<p id="""">Through this project, HI could reach 492 people, including 230 people with disabilities who benefited from integrated physical therapy and MHPSS services like Hamid did. In addition, HI trained 31 local health professionals on basic rehabilitation skills and management of patients with physical disabilities.</p>

<strong id="""">Syria. </strong> At 27 years old, Saad has seen many hardships. Saad was a computer engineering student when the war broke out. Shelling injured Saad’s eye and leg. The life he once knew was upended and like many Syrians, Saad had to flee and leave behind his studies and the life he once knew.
<p id="""">He moved north and eventually ended up in Afrin city, part of Aleppo governorate and not too far from the Turkish border. Married with four young children, and with little savings, Saad had to find employment quickly to support his family.  “I did not want to rely on aid, and, as young man, I must find a regular job to support my children,” Saad explained.</p>
<p id="""">With much effort, persistence and luck, Saad  applied for an internship in bakeries through the 'Kafaf' project. Bread is a staple in Syrian households and bakeries are integral to the social and economic fabric of the community.</p>
<p id="""">The project, managed by Takaful Al-Sham Organization and funded through the Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund, was designed to support the sustainability of bakeries and offer opportunities for people like Saad to learn valuable technical skills that could lead to job opportunities.</p>
<p id="""">“One day, I was browsing the Internet and I saw an announcement on Takaful Al-Sham's page about registering for an internship in “Kafaf” project. I rushed to apply, and the project team contacted me a few days later. Now, I am working in a bakery in the city of Afrin. I received occupational safety training and training on bakeries maintenance provided by the project team,” said Saad.</p>
<p id="""">Saad worked hard and learned as much as he could about how to repair the machinery at the bakery and how to help maintain it. Saad was also well-liked and regarded by his team and peers at work. After completing his internship, the bakery manager offered Saad a full-time position, where he will be one of the main members of the bakery’s maintenance team.</p>
<p id="""">“I was able to reach my goal and provide for my family, and I will continue to develop my skills and work to build a beautiful future for my children.”</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Niger, Niamey. </strong>When Hama Sorka, a 75-year-old fisherman from Saguia in Niamey, Niger, lost his house and livelihood this past October because of flooding in his neighbourhood, he was able to find refuge at Gamou camp in Niamey.</p>
<p id="""">Hama and his family received multisectoral assistance including shelter, emergency education, health care, water, sanitation and hygiene services from various humanitarian organizations. He now supports his family by selling basic supplies such as soap and mosquito repellent at the camp.</p>
<p id="""">But almost one year later, Hama and the nearly 7,000 other camp residents are calling for a speedy relocation, since the camp was only intended to be a transit site.</p>
<p id="""">“We urge the Government and its partners to speed up the relocation process to a new site,” said Hama.</p>
<p id="""">Needs in the camp are increasing because of the continuing flooding in the area. Tents are in poor condition and at risk of being destroyed by strong winds and heavy rainfall. Women and children remain the most vulnerable and in need of protection services.</p>
<p id="""">As of 24 September, more than 238,000 people have been affected by torrential rainfall and floods in Niger. The country continues to grapple with food insecurity, which affects more than 2 million people. In addition, as of 22 September, the Government to declare a cholera epidemic last month.</p>
<p id="""">Like most countries in the Central Sahel region, Niger is facing issues such as violence, insecurity, and extreme weather conditions due to climate change, which are being compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. The region is now one of the world’s fastest-growing humanitarian emergencies.</p>
<p id="""">Since the start of the 2021 rainy season in June, torrential rainfall has led to the collapse of more than 12,000 houses, the flooding of nearly 6,000 hectares of cultivable land, and the death of more than 10,000 livestock. Thousands of people have been rendered homeless and vulnerable due to the loss of livelihoods.</p>
<p id="""">Hama and his family are among the most vulnerable people, as they are already facing dire humanitarian situations in camps. Humanitarian organizations are responding to priority needs by providing food, shelter and non-food items. The Flood Contingency Plan for 2021 aims to help about 583,000 people in flood-prone areas.</p>
<p id="""">Government officials have confirmed the start of the operation to transfer some 12,000 people from Gamou camp and Hippodrome camp to the newly established Cité des Enseignants Chercheurs camp in Niamey.</p>

<strong id="""">South Sudan</strong>. Mary used to brew alcohol to earn money, but it wasn’t a reliable business. Married, but with her husband working elsewhere, she could not afford the education fees for her five children as well as basic living expenses.
<p id="""">In 2021, poor harvests, flooding, and conflict throughout South Sudan led many families like Mary’s to face mounting food insecurity.</p>
<p id="""">OCHA’s Country-Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs) and the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) are some of the most effective ways to ensure that life-saving assistance reaches people caught up in crises.</p>
<p id="""">In South Sudan and many other emergencies, the Funds work together to ensure the neediest people caught up in crisis receive the support they need, in South Sudan, funding food security, livelihoods, and nutrition in different regions of the country.</p>
<p id="""">In Tonj South, CERF supported WFP in scaling up a Food Assistance project to improve nutrition and reduce hunger through vegetable gardens. The project taught the most vulnerable community members basic agricultural skills, allowing them to sell their products in the market. For Mary, the vegetable plot earns her enough money to buy food at the same market, medication and to pay for three of her children to attend school.</p>
<p id="""">In Tonj North, CERF supported an FAO project with similar aims, distributing seeds, tools and fishing kits for 5,000 households. Aduol, also a mother of five, received seeds and training on planting and cultivation. “I was able to plant twice,” she said, “and I obtained a good harvest in my first field and am hoping for the same with my second.”</p>
<p id="""">Meanwhile, in greater Pibor, the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund supported NGO Joint Aid Management (JAM) to provide integrated food security and nutrition support for 60,000 people. Mary, living in Pibor, was able to get nutrition treatment for her baby daughter. She was also able to expand her vegetable garden to two acres, saving the money she earned selling vegetables to buy a water pump so that she could grow even more.</p>
<p id="""">The CBPF and the CERF funding was sequenced to most strategically support the response at the right time and in the right places.</p>
<p id="""">In January, CERF allocated $7 million to mitigate the risk of food insecurity and promote resilience; while the SSHF provided $4 million for agricultural and livelihood support. In April, CERF allocated $10 million for a multi-sectoral response timed to coincide with SSHF-funded seed distribution. And in July, the SSHF disbursed a further $28.5 million to sustain the response. This allocation also pre-positioned emergency rations and livelihood kits ahead of the dry season, resulting in broad and longer-term support of nutrition and Food Security and Livelihood activities across South Sudan.</p>

<strong id="""">Ethiopia</strong>, <strong id="""">Desnaech and Borena</strong>. Ethiopia faces chronic and acute food insecurity due to droughts and increasingly erratic rains. Severe drought is, unfortunately, becoming more frequent, affecting farmers and pastoralists alike.
<p id="""">In late 2021, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (EHF) responded to the severe drought in Ethiopia’s Somali and Oromia region. Some US $7 million from both funds was allocated to respond, reaching about 900,000 people.</p>
<p id="""">The CERF disbursed $5 million to FAO to safeguard livestock, protect the livelihoods of pastoral communities, and to UNICEF to ensure communities in the most vulnerable drought-affected areas could access safe water for themselves and their animals.</p>
<p id="""">CERF funding enabled FAO to distribute drought-resistant maize, onion and tomato seeds to farmers like Erasho Lolima and her husband Meria in Desnaech Woreda, SNNP. These were distributed in time for the harvest, following cash assistance to get people through the lean season. “Before harvesting, the cash assistance provided during the lean season was essential,” said Erasho. Afterwards, added her husband, “The [good] harvest should [allow us] to establish seed and food stocks to sustain our food security for the coming months.”</p>
<p id="""">Meanwhile, the EHF provided $2 million for health and nutrition interventions for children and vulnerable women, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. This allocation included national NGOs who were able to reach vulnerable groups in the most hard-to-reach locations.</p>
<p id="""">One of these people was Tilahun, an 81-year-old pastoralist who had been struggling through the extreme drought in Borena. With no pasture to feed his 12 cattle, and no clean drinking water, his animals were dying and his children dropped out of school. Dehabo, a grandmother also in the Borena area, suffered a similar fate, losing all seven of her animals. Both Tilahun and Dehabo’s children dropped out of school as their families could no longer afford fees. With pooled fund support, water trucking projects and school feeding programs made it possible to keep children in school and cattle alive.</p>
<p id="""">Working together, the two funds were able to reach more people affected by drought, allowing them to keep people and livestock healthy - and keep their livelihoods going beyond the lean season.</p>

<p id="""">Aisha explains: “ I now understand the different types of violence better and where women can get help. I was married off when I was too young and without my consent.”</p>
<p id="""">She adds: “At the end of NADA’s sessions, I decided I will never allow female genital mutilation to be performed on my daughter, and I want her to go to school. I talked about this with my husband and sisters, explaining the dangers of female genital mutilation and early marriage.”</p>

<p id="""">People are increasingly seeking mental health support—the Lebanese Humanitarian Fund funded national NGO RESTART Center to help respond. The RESTART Center recorded a 28 per cent increase in demand in 2021 among refugees and Lebanese (19 per cent and 57 per cent increase, respectively).</p>
<p id="""">LHF funded RESTART under the First Standard Allocation 2021 to provide specialized mental health services and community-based psychosocial support to over 1,000 vulnerable Lebanese migrants and refugees in Beirut, Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon and Akkar governorates.</p>
<p id="""">RESTART provides people with psychological first aid and psycho-social support services. Participants benefit from the support, but they know RESTART cannot fulfill all basic needs. They take comfort knowing that they are acknowledged, and their stories are worth attending to.</p>
<p id="""">One woman said: “I had forgotten what it feels like to be respected, and what it feels like to be a lady. You reminded me of who I used to be and who I am. You have given me the hope that I needed to keep going”.</p>
<p id="""">Each person approaches RESTART with a story to tell. In 2021, 100 per cent of participants reported improvements in at least one area of their mental health symptoms.</p>

<p id=""""><strong><em>Beirut, Lebanon. </em></strong>The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, today allocated US$4 million from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to respond to the fuel crisis in Lebanon and help avert a deterioration of the country’s humanitarian situation.</p>
<p id="""">The allocation will help 2.3 million people across Lebanon by making sure there is enough fuel to keep water stations functioning.</p>
<p id="""">The CERF allocation goes alongside a $6 million allocation from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund to help 65 hospitals in Lebanon, as well as primary health-care centres, dispensaries and medical cold chain storage.</p>
<p id="""">The fuel shortage, a result of the ongoing socioeconomic and political crises, is jeopardizing the availability of health care and drinking water for nearly everyone in Lebanon.</p>
<p id="""">“Fuel and electricity shortages are threatening essential health and water services across Lebanon, putting thousands of families at risk of a humanitarian crisis,” the Emergency Relief Coordinator said from the capital city of Beirut, where he is meeting with senior government officials and representatives of humanitarian and donor communities as part of a week-long visit to Lebanon, Syria and Turkey.</p>
<p id="""">“Many hospitals in Lebanon have already been forced to reduce their operations because of fuel shortages and electricity outages. The public water supply and wastewater treatment systems, which rely heavily on fuel, have been drastically cut across the country, leaving millions of people without access to water in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mr. Griffiths added.</p>
<p id="""">As part of the CERF allocation, the World Food Programme (WFP) will help supply fuel to hospitals, health-care centres, dispensaries and water stations. The funds will also support four water supply areas in Beirut – Bekaa, Mt. Lebanon, North and South – which serve more than two thirds of Lebanon’s population.</p>
<p id="""">Families in Lebanon have been increasingly relying on private water trucking, which is becoming unaffordable and unsafe. They are also at risk from contaminated water, which some suppliers have been distributing.</p>
<p id="""">Lebanon has been grappling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Syria crisis, and the aftermath of the <a id="""" href=""https://www.unocha.org/story/un-and-partners-respond-disaster-lebanon-immediate-deployments-and-assessments"">Beirut Port explosions in August 2020</a>. Increasing poverty, economic contraction and inflation have compounded needs among people living across Lebanon, including refugee communities.</p>
<p id="""">Since October 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost more than 90 per cent of its value, leading to a year-on-year inflation of 120 per cent between May 2020 and May 2021. Food prices increased 400 per cent between January and December 2020.</p>
<p id="""">Established by the UN General Assembly in 2005, <a id="""" href=""https://cerf.un.org/"">CERF</a> enables humanitarian responders to deliver life-saving assistance whenever and wherever crises strike.</p>

<p id="""">‍<strong>Afghanistan,Kandahar.</strong> In a remote village in the hot and dry province of Kandahar, Ahmad carries a heavy water barrel with the help of his 9-year-old son. They had traveled from their homes to another village to collect enough water to cover their daily needs – drinking, cooking, bathing and washing. The road is long, dusty and dangerous, and they must take a break every hour as they make their way home.</p>
<p id="""">Ahmad and his family fled their home village in 2021 because of violent conflict. The family of six settled in another village, but like many other displaced people, he does not have access to enough safe drinking water, and he cannot draw on local water sources due to land rights and high costs.</p>
<p id="""">The village where Ahmad’s family settled suffers from the worst drought in 30 years, and the second in 4 years. Water has become extremely scarce. Most villagers do not have access to safe drinking water, and the hand pumps are often broken, so they need to walk to other villages to fetch water. The lack of clean water and poor hygiene also leads to health issues, including water-borne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and other health problems.</p>
<p id="""">Usually, women and children are in charge of collecting water, which increases their exposure to violence and harassment. “I was always concerned about my children’s health due to the lack of clean water and the need to send them to another village to fetch water instead of going to school. In addition, the hand pumps in other villages are often broken, and we don’t know how to repair them properly,” said Ahmad.</p>
<p id="""">“Many people left [our area] because there was no water. But in September, a team from DACAAR visited the village and fixed the broken hand pumps. All the villagers felt relieved and happy because now we can finally access clean water in this village,” he added.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, DACAAR has rehabilitated broken hand pumps in districts across Kandahar. Aiming for long-term sustainability, DACAAR also provided training to the community on the operation and maintenance of wells, gave hygiene education and distributed hygiene kits.</p>
<p id="""">By providing safe water and delivering hygiene messages, the living conditions of people in crisis-affected communities, especially those in peri-urban and rural areas, can be vastly improved, particularly against a backdrop of COVID-19 and AWD and cholera outbreaks. Proper hygiene, clean water and ending open defecation are vital to prevent diseases, reduce pressure on already overwhelmed local health institutions, and increase school attendance.</p>

<p id="""">It was not always so. For many years, Palestinians in Gaza have been mostly isolated from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory and exposed to recurrent escalations in hostilities.</p>
<p id="""">As a result, many of them have not been able to work, and more than half the residents is poor. As Palestinian refugees whose families originate from areas now part of Israel, Lina and Ali are eligible for humanitarian assistance from the United Nations.</p>
<p id="""">But they have refused to rely on such support solely, and Ali has seized every opportunity to work and provide for the family. But sometimes, it was not enough.

<p id="""">“I want a normal home,” Lina told us. “Every time a season ends, I fear of what the next one will bring."" The May 2021 escalation of hostilities between Israeli forces and armed Palestinian groups in Gaza worsened the situation. It was devastating.

<p id="""">Subsequently, people who had already lived in poor conditions were now left with less than the little they had. The fighting took a heavy toll on Lina and Ali’s home. The ceiling was damaged, windows were shattered, and walls cracked.</p>
<p id="""">ACTED, supported by the occupied Palestinian territory Humanitarian Fund (oPt HF), stepped in to help. They provided Lina and Ali with cash assistance so they could fix the damage and make basic repairs to the house.</p>
<p id="""">With this support, they repaired two rooms, fixed their kitchen and bathroom, and bought a water tank. They also fixed the ceiling and the windows to protect the family from bad weather and secure some privacy.</p>
<p id="""">The support was part of a larger project. Overall, assistance was provided to over 200 households across Gaza. Families received cash to rehabilitate and make basic upgrades their homes, and beds, cleaning kits or other items were also provided. “My dream was to have a home where we can be protected and live our lives with dignity,” Lina said. “We made it come true.”</p>

<strong>Democratic of Congo, North Kivu. </strong>Alphonsine* remembers the night of 22 May 2021, when she and her family lost everything.
<p id="""">""Our field, our house and our livestock had gone up in smoke. ” Within hours, the village of Mugerwa was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano in the Province of North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Pregnant with her fifth child, Alphonsine only wished to get her family out of danger.</p>
<p id="""">After spending a few nights in neighboring Rwanda, they returned to the DRC and were immediately confronted with the lack of space in the sites for displaced people. ""We had no choice but to stay in a collective centre,"" set up in a primary school, says Alphonsine.</p>
<p id="""">The eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano has weakened many already vulnerable families. Women and children paid a high price, as they are committed to daily household chores, exposing themselves to assault, rape and other forms of violence. ""Finding food was a real headache. My husband would go into Virunga Park to look for firewood to make embers and sell them”.</p>
<p id="""">One morning, Alphonsine's husband was kidnapped, and a ransom was demanded to free him. ""For love of the father of my children, I decided to go”.  Alphonsine was raped by the kidnappers, just after her husband was released.</p>
<p id=""""> ""Between the physical and psychological suffering, I didn't want to live anymore. Until my path crossed with a community organization in my neighborhood. They were raising awareness about gender-based violence with megaphones. From afar, I heard them talking about free treatment in health centres, including in Kanyaruchinya, which is close to my home”.</p>
<p id=""""> Like other survivors who arrived at that health centre, Alphonsine was welcomed by a counsellor. ""Thanks to the discussions I had with her, I was able to talk to my husband about what happened to me. I was able to overcome my pain, and with her support, my child in the womb and I are healthy.”</p>
<p id="""">Today, Alphonsine and her family live together with a newly married couple who is kindly hosting them until they find a new home. She continues to participate in weekly discussions with other women.</p>
<p id=""""> Since June 2021, multi-sectoral assistance in health and protection, implemented by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), together with its partners Solidarité Féminine pour la Paix et le Développement Intégral (SOFEPADI) and Hope in Action, has provided support to many survivors of gender-based violence in the health zones of Nyiragongo, Kirotshe and Karisimbi.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the DRC Humanitarian Fund, these organizations provided dignity kits, medical care and psychological support to survivors.</p>
<p id="""">Throughout 2021, the Humanitarian Fund has funded six projects in 11 territories located in the provinces of Ituri, Maniema, North Kivu, South Kivu, and Tanganyika, to provide medical and psychosocial support to survivors of GBV and to enhance awareness raising in communities.</p>

<strong>Colombia, Barbacoas. </strong>Barbacoas, has been heavily affected by armed conflict. And, as in many places around the world, the pandemic led to increased violence against women and made access to care and justice more difficult.

A UN Women led project funded by the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), implemented by Fundeas and local municipalities, aims to strengthen the  response to gender-based violence. Resilience kits with emergency aid, food, hygiene kits were delivered to women-headed households, alongside education materials with information on referrals for violence, food security, and COVID-19 prevention.

“It’s not easy now that we are in the middle of a pandemic, when the cost of food and other items has increased, and many of us don’t have a permanent job,” said Ananis Caroline Cortes Henao, who received some of the supplies.

Updating the care routes for women affected by violence has also been necessary. Training was delivered to civil servants and local leaders to ensure they knew the system and could refer people effectively. “[These are] topics [one can] put into practice with one’s community and with one’s own family,” noted Estella Segura, a local leader in Barbacoas.

The project provides technical assistance and equipment for the shelter for women victims in Pasto, guaranteeing access to women with disabilities and prioritizing women from Barbacoas and Pasto, to provide care and protection for women throughout the region.

“For me, this humanitarian aid has been a support. Women are going through very difficult times in Barbacoas due to the pandemic. These grants are a helping hand for us as well as for our families,” said Cristina Castillo, a woman who participated in the project.

<p id="""">‍<strong id=""""><em id="""">Kharkiv Ukraine</em></strong>. According to the World Health Organization, there had been more than 260 verified attacks on health facilities at the 100-day mark of the conflict in Ukraine. These attacks resulted in substantial damage to Ukraine's healthcare infrastructure.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, UNOPS procured over 100 diesel electric generators and worked closely with Ukraine's Ministry of Health to identify and deliver the generators to the hospitals and clinics that needed them the most.</p>
<p id="""">The generators ensure hospitals have an independent source of energy if they are cut off from the national energy grid.</p>
<p id="""">They are thus critical to ensuring people in Ukraine can get the health care they need.</p>
<p id="""">“The [...] generators received from the United Nations will allow the operation of two hospital buildings at once,"" said Dmytro Dmytryshyn, Deputy Chief Physician at Svitlovodsk Central District Hospital, which received two generators.</p>
<p id="""">""This is extremely important for maintaining our energy stability, especially given the martial law imposed,"" he added.</p>
<p id="""">The Emergency Aid and Disaster Medicine Center in Kharkiv is the region’s central structure supporting the operation of ambulance teams.</p>
<p id="""">Around 200 ambulances cover the entire region, responding to calls from citizens. Viktor Zabashta, the Center’s director, noted:</p>
<p id="""">“We have received three generators. One of them has been stationed at the Center’s administrative premises, while the others have been allocated to our ambulance stations. Uninterrupted electricity supply is key to our work: we need a power source to support our dispatch services, Telecard system for gathering cardiographic data and GPS tracking for calls and vehicles movement, communication between the central office and the ambulance teams. Much of the equipment in use is electrical and needs to be recharged regularly, which is what the generators at ambulance stations allow to do.”</p>

<p id=""""><strong>South Sudan, Pibor. </strong>Gender-based violence in South Sudan is widespread. Several South Sudan Humanitarian-fund-supported projects are working, to prevent, mitigate risk, and scale up response services. Local NGOs Voice of Peace, Community Initiative for Development, and Joint Aid Management have been carrying out projects in Pibor to help women and girls.</p>
<p id="""">Voice of Peace, a national NGO, implemented one of these projects. They established women and girl-friendly spaces, where participants could discuss attitudes related to forced and early marriage and girls' education.</p>
<p id="""">Lucia is a mother of seven. She attended the Voice of Peace sessions and learned the risks of early marriage and the importance of education for girls. She made a change in her own home, persuading her husband that all their girls should go to school. Today, her three daughters attend Pibor primary school, and she hopes they will go on to complete secondary.</p>
<p id="""">Sadia attended the same workshops. She has five boys and one girl – who was ""engaged"" to an adult at the age of five. Following the workshop, Sadia opened a discussion with her husband and his parents – might the girl, now 13, be allowed to complete her schooling before marriage? The family took some convincing, but Sadia was able to get them to agree that her daughter enroll in and complete secondary school before getting married.</p>
<p id="""">Women also face forced marriage. Nya lost her husband during the 2013 war. It was normal in her community that she then became his brother's wife. The new husband was abusive. One day, she walked away. She met with teams from the Community Initiative for Development (CIDO), another South Sudanese NGO working on GBV. She worked with a counsellor and was able to overcome suicidal thoughts. She began working with CIDO to offer GBV prevention awareness to other women in the community. She hopes that sharing her story might encourage other women to speak out and seek help.</p>
<p id="""">Regina faced a similar experience – abuse at the hands of her husbands' brother, following her husband's death. She also left and fled to Pibor. Joint Aid Management (JAM), another NGO, supported her and other women to establish a community garden. From there, Regina expanded her garden and grew a thriving small business to support herself and her children.</p>

<p id="""">Najib and Habib have both taken part in learning sessions on child labor provided by Terre des Hommes Italy, in partnership with UNICEF and supported by the Central Emergency Response Fund. <a id="""" href=""https://www.unicef.org/lebanon/qudwa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">UNICEF’s QUDWA</a> programme is Lebanon’s first national Social and Behavioural Change and Communication Plan.

<p id="""">Both fathers are doing everything they can to ensure their children continue their education and pursue their degrees. “No one will love or care for my child like I do, and for that reason, I must care for them properly and protect them from any harm,” says Najib.</p>
<p id="""">In his grocery, Najib frequently discusses the importance of education and the dangers of child labor with his clients. With the tough economic conditions, he sees how child labor is becoming “normal” – and he’s trying to change the conversation.</p>
<p id="""">Habib, for his part, also engages his neighbors and friends in conversation on the importance of school and the danger of child labor, because “Education is the base for every child to lead a good life.”</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Ethiopia, Borena zone. </strong>Conflict and an unprecedented drought have driven increasing needs in Ethiopia this year. Humanitarians aim to reach more than 20 million people with humanitarian and protection assistance. Most of them are women and children.</p>
<p id="""">Ethiopia is experiencing one of its most severe droughts in forty years – with four consecutive failed rainy seasons since late 2020. Meanwhile, desert locusts devastated crops that livestock keepers rely on to feed their animals.</p>
<p id="""">Adi Tadhicha Walco and her family were displaced from their home by the fighting two years ago. She raises goats and cattle but has had trouble keeping them healthy during the drought and locust outbreaks over the last year that devastated their food crops.</p>
<p id="""">“I’m a widow, and we were scared during the COVID-19 movement restrictions [that created difficulties in 2020-21]. [This year,] the locust outbreak destroyed animal pastures, and rainfall has been low. Before the project, I was considering selling some of my goats to feed the family, and my cattle were emaciated and worthless on the market.”</p>
<p id="""">Abduba, a young father of four, found himself in a similar position. He could only send one child to school as his animals weren’t making the milk he relied on for income.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, Caritas Switzerland and ACORD supported Adi, Abduba, and families like theirs with animal vaccinations, animal feed, and voucher-based veterinary services.</p>
<p id="""">“[This support] has made for my family a more secure future. My assets were saved – I’m selling surplus milk daily, and none of my animals died. My children were able to stay in school and continue their education,” Adi says.</p>
<p id="""">Abduba noted that thanks to more animal feed and better veterinary services, he is finally seeing his cows make milk, which will help his family get back on their feet.</p>
<p id="""">The most recent forecasts project that October-December rainy season in 2022 will again be below average.</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Jordan, </strong>‍<strong id="""">Marka-Amman.</strong> Child labour is a major problem in Jordan. A recent report found 32 per cent of children experienced harassment at work, and many of them work under exploitative conditions that risk or harm their bodies, mental health and wellbeing.</p>
<p id="""">Most working children are boys (76 per cent), and most are teenagers between 15-17. Child labour  has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic because families face a poor financial situation, pushing them to send their children to work to make the money they need to survive.</p>
<p id="""">A Jordan Humanitarian Fund supported project, implemented by the Jordan River Foundation, aims to ensure the protection of children at risk of or already involved in, child labour , child marriage and other protection risks. The project reached 1,516 children in Jordan.</p>
<p id="""">Seif, a young Jordanian living in Marka-Amman, took part in a workshop run by the Jordan River Foundation.</p>
<p id="""">Seif already had negative attitudes toward child labour because he had peers who worked as mechanics and sold scrap metals. He knows they face many risks, and they tell him they wish to return to school.</p>
<p id="""">During the activities, Seif shared his experiences and the experiences of his relatives. He learned about other risks and consequences of child labour.</p>
<p id="""">Part of the training included a debate, and it was Seif’s opportunity to share his ideas and debate with another young person in the program. Saif’s position was against adolescent labour , and his opponent argued the “pro” side and financial benefits to the family.</p>
<p id="""">After the debate, Saif’s opponent said, “Saif convinced me that school is important, and I will return to complete school. I will prioritize my classes because education is like a sword that cuts off ignorance and abuse.”</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Nigeria, Yobe state.</strong><strong id=""""><em id="""">  </em></strong>The only working borehole broke down two years ago. This meant people had to walk more than half an hour each time they needed to collect water. The water supply infrastructure was damaged a few years earlier by non-state armed group attacks.</p>
<p id="""">When the people in Bulama Jafaru arrived at the only working water source miles outside of their town, they had to wait in long queues in the heat, as they were not the only people seeking water there. With frustrations running high, disputes quickly erupted at the congested water point.</p>
<p id="""">Jafaru Ibrahim, a leader in the community, remembers: “After the borehole broke down, there was no peace among the people. They would constantly get into a quarrel at the water point.” The overcrowded site increased the risk of contracting COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.</p>
<p id="""">To support the people of Buluma Jafaru and surrounding communities, Taimako Community Development Initiative (TCDI) ran a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) project in Gujba and Yunusari with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund.</p>
<p id="""">The project increased access to safe drinking water and promoted safer hygiene practices among communities most affected by the conflict.</p>
<p id="""">In Bulama Jafaru, the project rehabilitated the existing borehole and established a WASH committee of five men and five women who received training on borehole maintenance, crowd coordination at the water point and how to promote hygiene practices in the community.</p>
<p id="""">Having water that is safe and easy to access helps. With the borehole in the center of the community, women no longer have to walk long distances at all hours of the day. Also, children are not late to school because of having to stand in line at the water point.</p>

report,published,1,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"Working with communities to contain Ebola","Guinea | 2021 | CERF
<p id=""""><strong>Guinea,N'Zerekore. </strong>A few days after he referred one of his patients to the regional hospital, Dr. Emmanuel Goepogui, a private practitioner in N’Zerekore prefecture in south-eastern Guinea, received a visit from a community disease surveillance team. “They came to inform me that my patient had tested positive for Ebola and that I was a direct contact … I was then vaccinated along with my family members. After 21 days of follow-up, I was told that I was safe.”</p>
<p id="""">Ebola re-emerged in Guinea on 14 February, the first time since the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa. With CERF funding, the health authorities, in collaboration with teams from WHO and partner agencies, swiftly set up a community disease surveillance system alongside other Ebola prevention and control measures. Tracking the spread – identifying who has developed symptoms, where they live and who they have been in contact with – is a key part of curbing the virus. It helps in detecting cases quickly and isolating any close contacts.</p>
<p id="""">The disease surveillance teams go into communities to seek out suspected Ebola cases. This includes any person, alive or dead, who is presenting or has presented with a sudden onset of fever and at least three other symptoms of Ebola. “I have reported an average of 15 suspected cases a day to [Ebola case] investigators,” explains Dr Kebe Kalivogui, one of the 43 experts trained to find cases by WHO and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p id="""">However, alerts for suspected cases remain low and deaths in communities are not always reported to the health authorities. Fear of being stigmatized, or traditional or religious practices, sometimes undermine Ebola prevention measures. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. In N’zerekore, a community engagement team is working to overcome people’s reluctance to engage in Ebola prevention measures.</p>

<strong id="""">Niger, Diffa commune<em id="""">.</em></strong> Maimouna is 35 years old and a mother of four. She lives in Awaridi site in Diffa commune. Following attacks by armed groups, Maimouna left  her village to look for a safe place for her and her children. The departure was abrupt, and she left all her belongings behind. Until now they have been living in very basic conditions and not fully protected from the weather.
<p id="""">In November 2021, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and local partner ""Development for Well-Being"" - DEMI-E, launched a project to assist people affected by crisis in the communes of Diffa and Toumour. Years of conflict in the Western Sahel have eroded security in Niger’s border regions and led thousands of displaced people to seek safety in host communities. In the Diffa Region, in the east, regular attacks by Boko Haram since 2014 and entrenched insecurity cause regular displacement and disrupt livelihoods The region is currently home to more than 250,000 displaced people, many of whom live in inadequate housing with no access to essential items, like blankets and soap.</p>
<p id="""">The community worked with project staff to develop criteria for who should be prioritized for assistance. The community agreed these criteria during a village-wide meeting facilitated by CRS. After validating the criteria for vulnerable households, focus groups were organized with key decision-makers chosen by the community. With the help of project staff, they identified and classified households according to the criteria. The community agreed to prioritize aiding women-headed households, people living with sub-standard housing, and those caring for children under five.</p>
<p id="""">Based on this, Maimouna and her children received a shelter kit with supplies to improve their home, essential household items and a small cash allowance to purchase other things her family needs.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa, a pooled fund that supports humanitarian assistance in the Sahel region,  the project reached 800 vulnerable households. An earlier needs assessment conducted by CRS in 2021 found that nearly 75 per cent of vulnerable people lived in sites that did not meet their needs for shelter and household supplies, and so assisting people to improve their shelter is a critical priority.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Central African Republic, Alindao.</strong>  Four years ago, in 2018, Rodrigue*, then aged 16, joined an armed group in the hope of a better future. Bertrand*, also 16 at the time, joined to avenge the death of his father, who was killed during the conflict.</p>
<p id="""">The two now divide their time between school and the small shops they run, thanks to a project supported by the Central African Republic Humanitarian Fund (CAR HF).</p>
<p id="""">Rodrigue and Bertrand were among the 95 children and adolescents rescued from armed groups and reintegrated into the community in 2019 by Espérance, a Central African NGO, as part of a nine-month project to protect children and young people affected by the conflict.</p>
<p id="""">Children who had been separated from their parents were placed in foster families, and communities were sensitized to ensure social cohesion. The youth returned to school in 2020 and received school supplies. They were also supported in engaging in income-generating activities to strengthen their self-determination and independence.</p>
<p id="""">Rodrigue’s father had tears in his eyes as he recounted being reunited with his son. ""I thought that I had lost my son when he joined the armed group. I was moved, when one morning – it was Friday 11 September 2020 at 10 a.m. – I saw him come back home, promising not to leave again.”</p>
<p id="""">Since then, Rodrigue has been doing well for himself. He recently bought a bicycle with some of the income from his shop and is saving up for the future, hoping to enrol in university and become a teacher. ""When I am at school, my little brother takes over the shop so that I don't miss any customers. Our classes are at different times and this suits us,"" he says, as he counts the day’s earnings.</p>
<p id="""">Bertrand says the capital from his shop has been growing steadily, enabling him to buy a cassava mill, which brings in more income. ""With the money I earn, I buy my school supplies and I have also enrolled my niece in school, while supporting my mother,""says Bertrand.</p>
<p id="""">He points to his father's grave next to the house that is now his family’s home. ""Every time I saw this grave, I wanted justice to be done. That's why I joined the armed group,” he says, adding that he has now learned  to control his anger, speak out and make the right choices, thanks to psychosocial support he received from Espérance.</p>
<p id="""">Rodrigue and Bertrand’s families have lived at a site for internally displaced people in the town of Alindao since 2017, having fled their homes due to insecurity. Like them, more than 140,000 people still live at displacement sites across the CentralAfrican Republic.</p>

She blames the economic crisis ­– which has left about one third of the population unemployed – as well as her partial hearing impairment.</p>
<p id="""">Her daily struggle and her worries about her two boys and their futures, left her suffering from deep despair. Her family life was affected and she and her husband fought regularly. “I wanted to quit, I wanted to sleep and never wake up… I felt so depressed and miserable,”Sana said.</p>

<p id="""">Initially, Sana found it difficult to trust people at the safe space and talk of the emotional abuse she said was inflicted by the people closest to her. After attending multiple sessions, Sana was able to speak out openly about her concerns. “I became less worried and felt more capable and confident,” she said.</p>
<p id="""">Sana was also given cash assistance to support her and her family. “This month, I was finally able to buy vegetables and ingredients to prepare their favourite meals,” she said. She was also able to pay for educational support, which helped her children improve their school performance.</p>
<p id="""">""It is a heavy weight lifted off my shoulders knowing that I am at ease with my family,” Sana said.</p>

<p id="""">Every month, they receive WFP food baskets, distributed by the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF), but still, they barely make ends meet.</p>
<p id="""">As rental prices keep rising amid rampant inflation, the family has had to move to more affordable apartments on several occasions. To help keep her family afloat amid a plummeting economy, Rubin worked as a cleaner for eight years, and now teaches part time.</p>
<p id="""">After her second daughter was born, Rubin wanted to have more children. But when conflict broke out more than 11 years ago, she changed her mind. She did eventually have a third child in 2021, after what she said was a stressful unwanted pregnancy.</p>
<p id="""">While she was pregnant, her doctor told her that she had calcium deficiency, which, if not addressed could affect the baby. The doctor said she needed to consume dairy products every day, an additional expense she could not afford until the WFP-supported AKF threw her a lifeline.</p>
<p id="""">“They asked me if I wished to sign up for mixed food assistance that included a flexible e-voucher redeemable for fresh food.” Relieved and thrilled, Rubin immediately agreed. “I knew that with the voucher, I would be more capable of managing my family’s nutrition needs compared to receiving purely in-kind assistance.”</p>
<p id="""">Rubin says that after receiving the support, she would eat yogurt, cheese and meat to ensure she would deliver a healthy baby.  “Now while I’m breastfeeding, I also need to compensate my body for the elements it’s giving away.” She is also able to provide vegetables, eggs, yogurt and labneh for her children and uses some of the family’s income to buy diapers and cleaning products.</p>
<p id="""">In January 2022, CERF allocated $25 million to humanitarian response in Syria through its underfunded emergencies window. WFP received $6 million to provide food assistance and rehabilitate the bread value chain, with a focus on underserved and food insecure communities in Hama, Homs and Quneitra governorates.</p>

<p id="""">“The 2021 crop year was catastrophic in our region, since production was almost nil,” said Rahamatou Nayoussa, a 50-year-old widow whose family of eight eke out a living growing millet and sorghum. This year’s harvest was about six times lower than average, she said.</p>
<p id="""">She now collects gravel, which she sells to entrepreneurs ­– backbreaking work mainly carried out by women in Niger ­– while her children seek work in the fields of wealthier farmers.The income is barely enough for the family to survive, but Nayoussa says life has improved significantly since she received a first cash payment of 44,000CFA francs from WFP.</p>
<p id="""">“This assistance was like heaven-sent. The support came just at the right time, as it will enable me to buy food and to work in my fields. Hoping the harvest will be good at the end of this crop season,” said Nayoussa.</p>
<p id="""">Another recipient, Ramatou Ibrahim, 45, said she too had a very poor harvest in 2021, and borrowed money to set up a pancake stand to earn some money to feed her four children. “This assistance will allow me to repay the loan and get through the lean period without great difficulty,” she said.</p>
<p id="""">Responding to the food crisis in Niger, CERF allocated $10 million from its Underfunded Emergencies window to enable United Nations agencies and partners to provide life-saving assistance to 265,700 people. More than half the funding went to the World Food Program.</p>

Syria, Deir-ez-Zor. “I was about to die, and I felt really weak. My condition was deteriorating after hours of vomiting. I could only get to the nearest pharmacy since no health centres or hospitals exist in my village,” said Salem, a 35-year-old man from Al-Kubar village in rural Deir-ez-Zor.</p>
Since September 2022, cholera has been spreading across Syria. This outbreak is the first since 2009, brought on by the destruction of water infrastructure and record-low water levels in the Euphrates.

War and economic crisis weakened the healthcare system even before the outbreak. “Nearly 30 per cent of public health facilities in Syria remain non-functional,” warned Dr. Iman Shankiti, acting WHO Representative in Syria.
<p id="""">Money from the Central Emergency Response Fund helped close the most urgent gaps in health delivery, supporting access to services for over 750,000 vulnerable people in northeast and northwest Syria.</p>
<p id="""">‍This includes effective disease surveillance and early warning – which has been critical to the cholera response, and to helping people like Salem.</p>
<p id="""">‍Salem was lucky: the pharmacist he visited saw how sick he was and contacted a local health worker who was trained in <a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/surveillance/early-warning-alert-and-response-system-ewars/"">Early Warning, Alert, and Response (EWARS)</a>.

<strong id="""">DRC, Irumu territory.</strong> People in the Democratic Republic of Congo are dealing with a complex displacement crisis driven by chronic conflict. What that means in reality is that across the country, 26.4 million people – or one Congolese in four – are severely food insecure, despite the impressive agricultural potential of the land.
<p id="""">‍
Armed conflicts and gross human rights violations, including sexual violence and grave violations against children, continue to push millions of people to seek safety and security away from their homes: 5.7 million people are internally displaced, the highest number on the African continent.</p>
<p id="""">‍
With the support of the DRC Humanitarian Fund, Solidarités International provided direct cash transfers to more than 6,000 displaced families in the Irumu territory of Ituri province in the northeast. Forced to leave their homes due to resurgent armed violence, the cash transfers allowed families to cover necessities like food or school fees.</p>
<p id="""">‍
Solidarités put protection and accountability at the centre of the response. “They informed us how to feed back to them about the project, and told us that if we had complaints, we could approach the committee directly. This is the first time an NGO has come to talk to us in this way, and it was useful that they explained it to the whole village,” said Jacques, an honorary community chief.</p>

<p id="""">Emebet, 25, was displaced after hostilities and inter-communal violence broke out in her town, Arisiginele, in Oromia region.

<p id="""">“Our house was burnt to the ground and our livestock looted.  I lost everything in the blink of an eye,” Emebet recounts.  “I have no income and live off the support I receive from the community and some relatives,” she adds.</p>

<p id="""">James Okara,  the UNFPA Humanitarian Response Coordinator in Ethiopia said, “In any emergency, sexual and reproductive health and rights are often the most neglected of basic needs. When people are displaced, they carry only what is most essential. Sanitary items are usually not considered essential and are often left behind.”</p>
<p id="""">The lack of menstrual health supplies restricts mobility and personal choices. It affects attendance in school and participation in community life. And it can compromise access to support services during a crisis, causing additional stress and anxiety.</p>
<p id="""">Dignity Kits go hand-in-hand with health education and awareness raising where women and girls learn about the services available to uphold their rights and choices.</p>
<p id="""">“Ensuring that women and girls can easily receive critical information on their rights and choices is a crucial part of UNFPA’s work during an emergency.

<p id=""""><strong>Venezuela, outside Caracas. </strong>Carla González*, a 45-year-old woman from Venezuela, confesses that she was always very shy and found it difficult to relate to others or express her ideas publicly. She believes this low self-esteem was caused by past experiences with family members and partners. However, when she tells her story in a loud and confident voice, she seems to be talking about someone else.</p>
<p id="""">Everything changed one day when Carla decided to attend a talk for women in her community, Mario Briceño Iragorry, in Propatria, west of Caracas. For her it was like an awakening or the opening up of another world that no one had shown her before.</p>
<p id="""">Carla remembers when she first met the staff of <em id="""">Aliadas en Cadena</em>, the local NGO who organized the sessions. People talked about typical situations they faced in an area where the average income is just enough to live on. ""I couldn't make my own decisions, I couldn't say no. But talking about all this has helped me become stronger and know my worth as a woman. As a woman, I am independent and I can help others,"" Carla explains.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">Aliadas en Cadena</em> came to her neighborhood thanks to a project funded by the Venezuela Humanitarian Fund (VHF). The project aimed to empower women through training programmes to prevent, mitigate and respond to gender-based violence. ""Thanks to the Fund's support, we were able to reach over 9,000 people in different parts of the country. The various informative training activities and workshops have strengthened members of the communities as well as civil servants and officials in some public institutions,"" said Yomara Balzán, general manager of <em id="""">Aliadas en Cadena</em>.</p>
<p id="""">One of Carla's peers, 31-year old Rosana León*, says that learning about patriarchy, something she had only heard about briefly, inspired her to continue attending the workshops. ""Although I didn't experience it in my family, I did see it in other homes. I thought it was normal, but my parents told me it wasn´t the right way to treat women.""</p>
<p id="""">Rosana is grateful for the encouragement she received in the workshops, which helped her take a decisive step in her life and open a store in her community. The project also aimed to teach women how to support themselves and develop their own livelihoods. Without learning with women who had the same spirit of self-improvement, Rosana might not have dared to explore her entrepreneurial side.</p>
<p id="""">Thanks to this initiative, funded by the VHF, women survivors of gender-based violence received specialized counseling and psychological support. The project helped women in vulnerable communities, and reinforced work with indigenous women, prisoners and sex workers.</p>
<p id=""""><em id=""""> Aliadas en Cadena</em> helped many women to continue learning and seeking ways of improving their lives and their communities. Yomara Balzán said that women like Carla were also inspired to share what they had learned in the training. ""I feel happy and excited, because I can truly help people; I can help young people,” said Carla. “I am happy to be able to pass on what I have learned to others.""</p>

<p id=""""> ""I thought we were dead that day, my children and I,"" Yolande Felix recalls, describing the devastating quake.

<p id="""">Given the magnitude of need, CERF continued to provide support in 2022, following its rapid response to the earthquake in 2021.</p>
<p id="""">CERF allocated a total of $8 million in February – through the special funding mechanism for underfunded crises – to help over 428,000 people with their protection, livelihoods and basic social service needs arising from the earthquake in the South as well as from growing violence in the greater Port-au-Prince area. Both are compounded by the acute challenges for humanitarian organizations in reaching people in need.</p>

<p id="""">World Food Programme (WFP) Haiti, with support from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the government, distributed hot meals in the worst affected areas. “I would get my food every day in the morning to share with my children,” said Yolande, who moved with her family into a temporary shelter.</p>
<p id="""">Thanks to the funding CERF provided immediately after the earthquake and again in early 2022, displaced people have received essential household items, could get treatment at sexual and reproductive health clinics, and through cash transfers, could buy food and address other nutrition needs.</p>
<p id="""">More than a year after the quakes, there is still significant need for humanitarian assistance in Haiti, where a record 4.7 million people currently face acute hunger and the security situation continues to worsen, especially in the capital.

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Bangassou, Central African Republic.</strong>  Sitting in the courtyard of the <em id="""">Ma mbi si</em> centre, some 20 women and girls sing, draw patterns and knit blankets, tablecloths and clothing.</p>
<p id="""">The group, which includes youth, are all survivors of gender-based violence (GBV). The COOPI NGO provides psychosocial and other support at the centre – whose name means 'Listen to me' in the local language.</p>
<p id="""">“One day, about two years ago, armed men came into our village… When we tried to escape into the bush, a man grabbed me by the arm and then assaulted me,” says Laura* ,who is now 18. “For a long time, I hardly slept. Every time I closed my eyes I relived that moment.”</p>
<p id="""">""Here I feel better because psychologists listen to me. And spending time with women who have experienced similar ...helps me to move forward. We support each other when morale is low.” Laura says she earns money thanks to the knitting skills she acquired at the centre. “With this income I can buy some food and medications… and save for the next school year.”</p>
<p id="""">Socio-cultural norms that disadvantage women and girls contribute to GBV, which includes physical and psychological violence, rape, early marriage and female genital mutilation. The situation in the Central African Republic is exacerbated by a more than decade-old conflict.</p>
<p id="""">Every hour, almost three people are victims of GBV in the Central African Republic, with more than 17,830 cases recorded in the first 9 months of 2022 – 53 per cent more than the figure for the whole of 2021, according to the GBV Information Management System (GBVIMS).</p>
<p id="""">In June 2022, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) provided funding to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the project implemented by COOPI, which operates <em id="""">Ma mbi si</em> centres in Bangassou, Alindao, Zémio and Obo, as well as a free telephone helpline for GBV survivors.</p>
<p id="""">GBV, especially physical attacks and sexual violence, leaves survivors with lasting damage. To help them rebuild their lives, COOPI provides a holistic response that addresses the physical, psychological, legal and economic needs of survivors.</p>

report,published,1,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"Local organizations reach remote communities in need","Venezuela | 2023 | VHF
<p id="""">Venezuela. As 2023 begins, 7.7 million people need humanitarian assistance in Venezuela due to prolonged economic problems, chronic inflation, and sectoral sanctions, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, political polarization and localized violence.</p>
<p id="""">“Given the situation in the country, we have had to learn a new way to do our work and be present in the community, specifically around implementing humanitarian projects,” says Nhelsyr González, director of local organization Acción Campesina.</p>
<p id="""">The Venezuela Humanitarian Fund (VHF) has prioritized funding local organizations. This has helps empower Venezuelan NGOs to deliver the assistance people so desperately need.</p>
<p id="""">The most critical needs relate to food insecurity and access to basic services, as well as protection risks for people on the move. “Working with the Venezuela Humanitarian Fund has been critical because it has allowed us to continue working, and to ensure families have enough to eat and safe water,” added Ms. González.
Working directly with local partners also allows donors to support work in the most remote areas, where international organizations may not have a strong presence.</p>
<p id="""">“The VHF funds projects in the most remote areas of Venezuela,” says Daniela Inajosa, Director of local organization Tinta Violeta, which does protection work to combat gender-based violence.</p>
<p id="""">“It’s critical that VHF continues to receive support – because they have done something really important: they have focused on local organizations and strengthened our ability to deliver. This allows us to respond in a more effective and resilient way.”</p>
<p id="""">In 2022, 66% of VHF’s first funding round, and 73% of the second went directly to local organizations. This allows the best-placed partners to support the most vulnerable people and helps local organizations pivot to or strengthen existing humanitarian programming.</p>

report,published,1,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"New life after the storms","<p id=""""><strong id="""">CERF in underfunded emergencies: Honduras</strong></p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">In January 2022, CERF allocated $5 million from its Underfunded Emergencies (UFE) window to support relief operations in Honduras.</em></p>
<p id=""""><strong id="""">Honduras, San Pedro Sula. </strong>San Pedro Sula, Honduras’ main industrial hub and second largest city after the capital, Tegucigalpa, lies in the middle of the flood-prone Sula Valley near the country’s north-western Caribbean shores. When Hurricane Mitch struck as a category 5 storm in 1998, it cut a path of destruction through SanPedro Sula, washing away homes and, in some cases, entire communities, causing the kind of damage that would set back the country’s development by years, if not decades. The city again came under siege from extreme storms in 2020, when Eta and Iota barrelled over Honduras as category 4 hurricanes within two weeks of each other, leaving 2.8 million people in need in the midst of the COVID-19pandemic.</p>
<p id="""">Many in poorer areas surrounding the city have yet to recover. Because of the persistent threat of flooding and major storms, such as Tropical Storm Julia that struck in October 2022, humanitarians maintain a constant presence to support the people of San Pedro Sula. In the La Planeta sector of the neighbouring La Lima municipality, some services have still not been fully restored.</p>
<p id="""">Recurrent storms and flooding can leave the Dr. Afonso Hernández Córdova Health Centre in La Planeta inoperable for weeks, or even months on end, disrupting access to health services, including critical sexual and reproductive (SRH) services that nearly 6 out of every 10 women in Honduras say they lack.</p>
<p id="""">The Ministry of Health centre, which has been receiving support from organizations such as UNFPA, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and Doctors of the World for years, has still not been able to restore laboratory or dentistry services since the last major flooding to affect San Pedro Sula.</p>
<p id="""">“We had four floods in one month, water as high as two and a half metres. It took us six weeks to clean up just to provide consultations, we had no working equipment or supplies,” says Dr. Vladimir Rodriguez, the centre’s general practitioner. He says that support from humanitarian organizations has become indispensable to keeping the centre going and building community outreach. The centre relies on a UNFPA-trained network of local volunteers to work with women, including pregnant women. Thanks to these volunteers, women in the community can find out about family planning they might otherwise be unable to access or feel uncomfortable seeking.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">“We started this from nothing after the storms… Now it actually makes me smile to see how peer-to-peer support in the communities has spread so much,”</em> says Rodriguez.</p>
<p id="""">CERF funding has allowed for the training of volunteers, as well as the provision of medical supplies and equipment. With the January 2022 allocation, the SRH sub cluster was also able to provide technical assistance to health personnel, install mobile teams at a time when there was no operational health facility to provide clinical management of sexual violence, family planning counselling and delivery of contraception, gynaecological and prenatal care. Affected women in shelters and communities also received hygiene kits and information on the importance of SRH care during emergencies.</p>
<p id="""">Thirty-year-old Kensi said she and her partner planned her pregnancy with support from the community volunteer network.</p>
<p id="""">“The trust we have with the volunteers is important, they have to be patient with us pregnant women,” said Kensi, who was scheduled for a check-up with Dr. Rodriguez. “They’re almost like psychologists, talking us through the process from family planning methods through to the decision to become pregnant,” she added.</p>
<p id="""">The counselling provided by the network includes information on routine check-ups, exams and medicines, which Rodriguez notes goes a long way in correcting misconceptions around family planning.</p>
<p id="""">Dispelling these myths are exactly what girls and women in La Planeta need, according to Kensi. “You see 14-, 15-,16-year-old girls becoming pregnant because they haven’t had guidance on family planning, but thanks to the volunteers, we have the knowledge to properly plan our families.”</p>
<p id="""">Rodriguez notes his gratitude for all that humanitarian organizations have done for the volunteer network and the centre.  “If it weren’t for the assistance we’ve received, I honestly don’t know how we’d be doing right now.”The network’s success has encouraged Rodriguez to make plans for a women-only clinic.“We’ve outgrown this space, there aren’t any clinics with enough room,” says the young doctor.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Central African Republic, Bocaranga. </strong>Concern and outrage show on the faces of the men gathered in a classroom in the town of Bocaranga, as they are shown illustrations – alongside explanations in the Sango language – depicting different types of explosive devices, their horrific impact and how to minimize risk.</p>
<p id="""">Naketia Paulin, a farmer in his early twenties, says he is worried about the risk he faces when he works in the fields. ""I have to leave the town regularly to work in the ﬁelds. Sometimes I hear that devices have exploded not far from where we farm, causing injuries and deaths, and I am worried because if I don't go to the ﬁelds, my family might starve,"" he told the other participants at the presentation.</p>
<p id="""">The explosive devices are yet another threat in the Central African Republic, where one in four people have fled their homes due to insecurity, 2.2 million people are severely affected by food insecurity and 80 per cent of the population live in poverty.</p>
<p id="""">Between January and November 2022, 11 people were killed and 42 injured in 40 incidents involving explosive devices. Three in four victims were civilians, including 19 children.</p>
<p id="""">The presence of explosive devices severely affects the livelihoods of people, particularly the most vulnerable.  ""We live in fear because we can no longer go about our business with peace of mind,"" says Paulin.</p>
<p id="""">The pictures shown in the Bocaranga classroom are part of efforts to sensitize the most vulnerable people in the area. The project is run by the NGO Humanity &amp; Inclusion (HI) in Bocaranga and ﬁnanced by the CAR Humanitarian Fund. Women, men and children, including people with disabilities, are educated about the dangers of explosive devices and learn safe behaviours that reduce the risks.</p>
<p id="""">""This session helped me to understand what different types of explosive devices look like and the ﬁve key actions to take: stop immediately, retrace your steps, mark the ground, inform the authorities and call the 4040 hotline to report the discovery,"" says Sylvie, one of the participants in a session for women.</p>
<p id="""">The explosive ordnance risk education sessions are tailored to the target groups, with sessions for children and sessions for adults,  provided in the language spoken by each community. This ensures that everyone has access to the information they need to adopt safe behaviours and enhance their security through threat mitigation.</p>
<p id="""">As of 14 October 2022, 2,500 people, including 1,280 children, 170 people with disabilities and 300 internally displaced persons (IDPs), have beneﬁted from explosive ordnance risk education. In addition, HI has trained 40 humanitarian workers in Ouham-Pendé on the risks associated with explosive devices.</p>
<p id="""">To ensure rapid reporting and response in case of discovery of explosive devices, the project, in collaboration with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), provides participants with an emergency telephone number. A major poster and radio campaign is planned to educate as many people as possible about protective measures.</p>
<p id="""">""I didn't pay attention to objects on the road before, but now I know that we have to be very careful with all unidentiﬁed objects, particularly those shown to us during the training. I am ready to inform those around me about how to save our lives,""says Paulin.</p>

Everyone knows Natacha and praises her for her selflessness and desire to support others, despite the many challenges faced at the clinic.</p>
<p id="""">The clinic was one of the health centers most damaged during the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that hit south-western Haiti on the 14th August 2021, rendering one of the two buildings completely unusable. Along with the two other nurses, a social nurse and a guard, Natacha eats and sleeps in the only room where services can be delivered.</p>
<p id="""">The facility does not have a resident doctor. It has been challenging to support the community with so few resources.</p>
<p id="""">On top of those challenges, the facility’s solar electrical system was stolen in February 2021. This forced Natacha to regularly deliver emergency services in the dark, often attending the delivery of babies. Mothers who had not received proper follow ups would arrive in the middle of the night, desperately needing Natacha’s help to deliver safely.</p>
<p id="""">Natacha recalls delivering a baby in front of the hospital gate, using her phone’s light to see through the darkness.</p>
<p id="""">With support from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) evaluated the damage in some of the clinics and hospitals around the three southern departments of Haiti in order to provide some support with infrastructure repairs of the most affected facilities.</p>
<p id="""">In the <em id="""">Centre de Sante de Duchity</em>, after an assessment, the IOM decided to install a new solar system consisting of 9 solar panels, 12 batteries of 225V, a regulator and an inverter in order to ease the life and work of the medical staff working in the facility.</p>
<p id="""">While this has not solved all clinic's problems, Natacha says that having power has improved her work, especially in responding to night-time emergencies.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Bentiu, South Sudan</strong>— “Everything is gone, I have to start afresh.”</p>
<p id="""">Since Tut Patai’s father introduced him to cattle keeping at a tender age, he has spent his life surrounded by hundreds of cattle—until last year when disaster hit.</p>
<p id="""">In the months that followed heavy flooding in September, the 45-year-old lost over 120 animals. “Because of the floods I have lost all my cattle,” says Mr. Patai, looking at the only remaining cow and calf. The animals look sick, and their bones are protruding.</p>
<p id="""">“They don’t have enough to eat because the grass is underwater.”</p>
<p id="""">Every day, Mr. Patai wades through the flood waters to collect grass to feed his two animals. It has been like this since he returned to his home village in the Shilack area of Rubkona town.</p>
<p id="""">Mr. Patai is not alone. His neighbor, Gatkuoth Mut Baboth had 250 cattle. But nearly 200 of them have died.</p>
<p id="""">“I don’t know if the remaining 50 will survive,” says the 42-year-old. “Some people have lost more than me.”</p>
<p id="""">“Life is going to be very hard,” he says of the future that awaits the pastoralist community.</p>
<p id=""""><strong id="""">Record flooding</strong></p>
<p id="""">This is the scale of destruction caused by record flooding in Bentiu, the northern town of South Sudan’s Unity State. Locals say it is the worst flooding they have experienced in 60 years.</p>
<p id="""">Across the country, record rainfall in the past three years and overflowing rivers, flooded thousands of hectares of farmland in eight states – preventing people from planting crops. More than 850,000 people have been affected across the country and need urgent life-saving support.</p>
<p id="""">In the worst-hit Unity State, at least 220,000 people have been affected, including 110,000 who were already displaced due to conflict.</p>
<p id="""">The harsh effects of the floods in Bentiu have marooned people in highlands and camps protected by dikes holding back floodwaters.</p>
<p id=""""><strong id="""">Recovery efforts supported by OCHA pooled funds</strong></p>
<p id="""">Since the onset of flooding last year, IOM scaled up critical infrastructure works to secure displaced persons camps and the residents of Bentiu and Rubkona towns.</p>
<p id="""">To recover submerged villages, IOM is constructing and reinforcing berms and dikes, and pumping stagnant waters out over the dikes to ensure continued humanitarian access along core supply roads.</p>
<p id="""">With support from the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF), and the United Nations Central Emergency Fund (CERF), IOM reclaimed submerged villages including Shilack, a village of about 100,000 square meters in Rubkona town.</p>
<p id="""">The initial work involved sandbagging sections of the dikes that were damaged, deployment of excavators to rehabilitate the most critical sections of the dike and discharging water over the dikes.</p>
<p id="""">“For us to be able to stand here, and for the children that have returned with their families, it has taken at least one and a half months of significant recovery works involving sandbagging, deployment of excavators to rehabilitate the most critical sections of the dike and discharging water for at least 18 hours every day,” explains Joshua Kanyara, IOM’s Emergency Coordinator in Bentiu.</p>
<p id="""">“We deployed 8 trash pumps that have been running for at least 18 hours every day.”</p>
<p id="""">“Nobody thought we would recover this area, but the work is progressing well.""</p>
<p id="""">Significant progress has been made on targeted infrastructure activities in the Internally Displaced Peoples camp, Rubkona and Bentiu preventing the likelihood of flooding from initial rains.</p>
<p id="""">So far, 28.2 kilometers of dikes have been completed and more than 15.52km of access road rehabilitated in Bentiu town.</p>
<p id="""">The recovery work has given hope to displaced people, some of whom have returned. Rubkona Primary School which had remained closed after it was submerged has been renovated and reopened.</p>
<p id="""">“Our village was submerged with water but now it has been recovered. We thought as a community the water will not disappear, but IOM stood with us that’s why the water has been pumped back to where it came from.

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Central African Republic, Kaga-Bandoro.</strong> It is Tuesday morning and a cluster of women and their babies gather under a blue canopy at a site for internally displaced persons (IDPs), where the children, who all suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), receive weekly treatment.</p>
<p id="""">Jonvienne, 20, sits on a straw mat as her 18-month-old daughter, Richardine, crawls on the ground.  The baby is tiny for her age. She cannot stand – her muscles are too weak. Two weeks ago, community health volunteers identified her as malnourished and referred her for treatment.</p>
<p id="""">“The child had been sick for a while, but I didn’t know what she had and worried a lot,” Jonvienne says. Since birth, Richardine has only drunk breast milk. “And now, milk has become scarce,” says Jonvienne, who has been living at the IDP site for 10 years. “I don’t think I eat enough to produce milk.”.</p>
<p id="""">Food shortages and malnutrition are alarming in the Central African Republic, which is mired in a conflict that has triggered massive displacement, and is struggling with widespread poverty exacerbated by rising prices, fuel shortages and deteriorating infrastructure.</p>
<p id="""">A total of 2.7 million people are acutely food insecure, according to September 2022 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) estimates. This represents 44 per cent of the population, one of the world’s highest levels of food insecurity.  About 400,000 people, or 6.6 per cent of the population, suffer from acute malnutrition, according to a 2022 SMART analysis.</p>
<p id="""">Against this backdrop, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) allocated US$15 million – through its rapid response mechanism – in mid-2022, to benefit 200,000 people in 10 sub-prefectures where food insecurity is most severe. The allocation enabled six United Nations organizations and partner NGOs to expand food distributions, cash transfers and livelihood support, as well as nutritional support and access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation facilities.</p>
<p id="""">Thanks to the funding, the NGO <em id="""">Médecins d’Afrique</em> has been treating 1,369 children aged 6-59 months for SAM at the three IDP sites and 10 health facilities in Kaga-Bandoro. The children receive ready-to-use therapeutic food, antibiotics, anti-malarial medicine, deworming tablets and Vitamin A.</p>
<p id="""">The children’s mothers are also given soap and water purifiers, buckets and containers to store water, and reusable sanitary pads – critical supplies given that inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene is responsible for about 50 per cent of global malnutrition. Education sessions are held weekly, with topics including healthy diets for babies and young children, best breastfeeding practices, age-appropriate foods for young children and the importance of hygiene in food preparation.</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Burkina Faso, Boucle du Mouhoun. </strong>For Sali, 27, the memory of her sexual assault remains raw, but she says that getting support and knowing the perpetrator is behind bars, has been a great help.</p>
<p id="""">“I was coming home from my condiment business one evening around seven, when I was assaulted and sexually abused. My tormentor also robbed me of my earnings for the day,” said Sali, who has a disability.</p>
<p id="""">A friend advised her to contact Abba's International Healing Center (AIHC). “The NGO’s counsellor listened to me and provided psychological support, which really allowed me to let off steam,” Sali said.</p>
<p id="""">She also received a cash transfer, which she said enabled her to access ‘full care services’ and resume her condiment business. “The day I received the transfer message, I cried with joy because I had never imagined receiving such a sum,” she said.</p>
<p id="""">The NGO also provided legal support, which helped ensure the perpetrator was put on trial and sentenced to prison.</p>
<p id="""">AIHC is a UNFPA implementing partner in the Boucle du Mouhoun region of Burkina Faso, where it conducts activities to combat gender-based violence (GBV), thanks to funding from CERF.</p>
<p id="""">In December 2021, CERF allocated $10 million from its underfunded emergencies window for humanitarian activities in Burkina Faso to provide 100,000 vulnerable people in remote and hard-to-reach areas with assistance. The funding included a grant to a UNFPA project to provide GBV protection assistance to 8,694 people, including 148 persons with disabilities.</p>

report,published,1,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"Water is life: helping people face unprecedented drought","Somalia | 2022 | CBPF
<p id=""""><strong id="""">S</strong><strong id="""">ool, Somaliland and Nugaal, Somalia. </strong>Ayesha Suguli leads a family of 20 in Dhabansar. Throughout her life, travelling long distances to collect water has been normal.</p>
<p id="""">But the ongoing drought has made this difficulty extreme. “You realize the importance of water when it’s not easily accessible to you,” says Ayesha. In Somalia, four consecutive rainy seasons have failed, a climatic event not seen in at least 40 years.</p>
<p id="""">Sahra Jamac, who lives in Nugaal region in a village of about 1,000 people, observed, “This drought is devastating and shocking compared to the previous droughts we lived through…this is the first time I have lost all my animals.”</p>
<p id="""">About <a id="""" href=""https://ochasomalia.org/hpc/"">7.8 million people are expected to be affected by the drought,</a> which has already devastated the lives and livelihoods of the most vulnerable and marginalized people, including women, children, and minority clans. 805,000 people are newly displaced because of the crisis.</p>
<p id="""">Ayesha’s livelihood situation is similar to Sahra’s. “Half (our livestock) have died because of the drought. When the shallow wells started drying up, we ended up paying for water trucking, which was expensive for us. Men in the family will take care of the livestock while women and children will take care of water for household use. We carry gallons of water on our backs every day and walk for kilometres, which causes us back pain too.”</p>
<p id="""">“Walking for long distances wasn’t safe for us women,” Ayesha added.</p>
<p id="""">Jamac lost his arm in fighting nearly two decades ago. His village has been facing drought for over four years. “We didn’t have access to safe water and…there were no [safe and clean] latrines.”</p>
<p id="""">The Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) supported ACTED, which is providing displaced people and host communities in Ayesha and Jamac’s area with WASH assistance like water distribution and the rehabilitation of critical boreholes. “Now with the borehole, we are getting water for household use,” says Jamac.</p>
<p id="""">Meanwhile, Himilo Organization for Development, a local NGO, used SHF funding to provide vulnerable families like Sahra’s with cash transfers. Partners working in the area note that, while there is still more to be done by humanitarian organizations to avert the impact of the drought, cash transfer does play a critical role in reducing vulnerability.</p>
<p id="""">“I was struggling to feed my children but now with a monthly stipend, I can afford to buy food for them and help them to go to school. It is not a lot, but we can get what we need at the time,” says Sahra. Himilo Organization is also trucking water, a vital lifeline for many families in the area.</p>
<p id="""">A similar programme, implemented by Action Aid, distributed cash to Ruqia and her family. “Buying food was the main priority for me,” she explained. “I [had] almost forgotten what good food used to be.” Ruqia lives in a displacement camp, and works in a slaughterhouse – but it is not enough to feed her family.</p>
<p id="""">More challenges lie ahead, and people will need more humanitarian assistance to ensure safety, survival and dignity as Somalia continues to live through this drought. In the displacement camp where Ruqia lives, Farxakule, many women lead households alone. “Look around the camp and see what kind of life we have,” says Ruqia.</p>
<p id="""">Jamac wishes his children had more opportunities, “When I think of the future for my grandkids, I wish them a good life where they have access to education, the necessities of life and a good career. I don’t want the kids to think and worry about water in this age, I want them to think and carry books and pens rather than water buckets.”</p>

<p id="""">The child-friendly space, run by Ukrainian NGO People in Need with funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, is staffed by an experienced psychologist. Children can speak with the psychologist, join in art therapy, or just play inside or outside in the garden. Friendly activity leaders lead them in crafts. ""These are the most fun gingerbread cookies in the world!"" laughed one child.</p>
<p id="""">Children come from all different places affected by the war – Dnipro, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia itself. Through the center, over 1,500 of them have accessed psychological support and found a place to play before moving on in their journeys.</p>
<p id="""">Aliona, a psychologist working in the center, says “The dog’s presence alone helps improve the children’s [mental] state. Reading books and telling story, dance and movement therapy” and more are all available to the children.</p>
<p id="""">Almost all the walls are decorated with colorful art, and words of appreciation. Each art piece reflects the history of one child whose escape from the war led them through this place.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Yemen, Ta'iz.</strong> Hussain, now 24, said he would never forget the fear he felt five years ago when he and his family fled fighting. He didn’t have a chance to pack his bags.</p>
<p id="""">“I didn’t want to leave my home, I had nowhere to go. The conflict left us with no choice but to run,” he said.</p>
<p id="""">One of the nearly 450,000 people internally displaced in Yemen, Hussain had been a farmer in Mawza. It was difficult to transfer his skills to the city of Aden, where the family fled initially. He couldn’t make a living there, and they got into debt. They moved back to Ta’iz, but their house was very basic and unfinished.</p>
<p id="""">“The debt has been a real burden on me. I could not afford to pay back the money while also trying to earn money for materials to improve our shelter and buy the basics like food or cooking utensils,” said Hussein. He really worried about providing for his wife and child.</p>
<p id="""">Meanwhile, in Ma’arib, Alia, aged 18, was living with her sister and brother-in-law. Her three nephews — Moshaeel, Ameer, and Madian — love her like their own sister. Alia has a brain condition that makes it difficult to walk on her own.</p>
<p id="""">When the family fled Harib because of clashes there and returned to Ma’arib, it was difficult to start over again. Their new house was in disrepair and wasn’t adapted for Alia’s special needs.</p>
<p id="""">“Alia felt uneasy most of the time. Staying home for a long time affected her psychologically. Having to be carried every time she goes out makes her uncomfortable and nervous,” explained her sister, Manal.</p>
<p id="""">Cash assistance helps families choose how to respond
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF) provided multi-purpose cash assistance to Hussein and Alia’s families, which eased some of their hardships.</p>
<p id="""">More than 6,000 other families displaced by the fighting or economic crisis - and now living in Yemen’s northern governorates, along the west coast and in the Ma’rib - also received cash assistance from the programme in 2022.</p>
<p id="""">Hussain’s family paid off the debt that was holding them back, bought some food, and made further progress on repairing their house.</p>
<p id="""">“I was very happy when I received the money, I even cried. It helped my family so much. I managed to pay my debt back and buy some basics such as flour, rice, oil and medicine. And with help from some neighbors and friends, I built a small room for my family to sleep in,” added Hussein.</p>
<p id="""">Alia’s family bought her a new wheelchair to allow her to go outside more easily.</p>
<p id="""">“Alia could not stop laughing the day she received her wheelchair. She was so proud and happy,” explained Manal, her sister. “Going outside is very important for everyone, but it has even more impact on people living with disabilities. Alia’s psychological and physical conditions change for the better every time we take her outside,” said Manal.</p>
<p id="""">“Multipurpose cash assistance provides greater flexibility and choice for displaced families,” explains Mohammed Abbas, a member of IOM’s Cash-Based Intervention Team.</p>

<p id="""">They include 6.3 million who have been internally displaced, nearly 7 million who remain in their homes, and 4.4 million who have returned home. Across the country, peoples’ homes and critical civilian infrastructure have been destroyed.</p>
<p id="""">It is hard to make a living – and about half of Ukrainians have seen their salaries fall, according to the Central Bank of Ukraine.</p>
<p id="""">The Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund and other donors have supported ACTED to scale up their cash programme, which was operating before the war but at a much smaller scale.

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Ukraine, Kharkiv, Ternopil, Odesa.</strong> The war in Ukraine continues to cause large-scale displacement.  Millions of people have moved internally or abroad, trying to find a safe and affordable place to live.</p>
<p id="""">When a family flees their home, there is often little time – or space – to take more than a few necessities. People need financial support to cope and to start their lives from scratch, often in a new place far from home. Since February 2022, the Danish Refugee Council – with funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund – has provided over 4,000 people with cash grants, and they continue to scale up.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">Fleeing home - again</em></p>
<p id="""">Eight years ago, Olena, 34, fled Donetsk city and settled in Kharkiv after conflict began in eastern Ukraine. But, after the massive bombings in February 2022, Olena, her husband and two children, aged two and eight, had to shelter in a Kharkiv subway station for two weeks along with hundreds of other people.</p>
<p id="""">""Everyone thought this horror would end in a few days, but weeks passed, and the children started to get sick. It was cold there, and with so many people in enclosed space, the viruses spread quickly,"" says Olena.</p>
<p id="""">Olena and her family escaped to Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine. With so many people on the move, demand for housing is high – and Olena and her family were lucky to find a village summer house. ""We took only the essentials from Kharkiv. My husband lost his job, and I am on maternity leave – so we are short of money,"" she explains.</p>
<p id="""">With a grant from the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) she was able to buy groceries and clothes, and paid some utility bills. She also bought papers and pencils for the children and internet connection for their online schooling.</p>
<p id="""">Kateryna, 35, had to take out loans to move her four children to a new city and apartment when fighting broke out. She used the cash grant from DRC to repay some of those loans and buy needed medicine for the kids. She also bought school supplies and paid some of the rent.</p>
<p id="""">Sofia, 21, was pregnant when she and her boyfriend left Kramatorsk on an evacuation train. At first, they lived in a temporary shelter – as rent had doubled. The cash grant from DRC helped them prepare for the baby. ""We bought winter clothes. Part of the sum was spent on rent. And we were able to buy necessities for a newborn, like a pram."" They live now in Odesa, in the south of Ukraine, and her boyfriend was able to find a job there.</p>
<p id="""">Cash assistance is a critical element of humanitarian aid, because it gives people the flexibility to buy what they need – whether it's food, shelter, medicines, internet access or paper and pencils for the kids. And these necessities have helped people get through difficult times.</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Ukraine.</strong> The invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has caused death, destruction, displacement and deprivation. People fled their homes and struggled to survive in uncertain conditions. If they survived bombs and forced displacement journeys, they then had to work out how to afford food, find temporary shelter, or get medical help.</p>
<p id="""">From the start, the Central Emergency Response Fund – the United Nations’ global emergency fund – moved quickly to give money to humanitarian organizations that help people in need. CERF disbursed over US$60 million, starting from the very first day of bombing on 24 February.</p>
<p id="""">Kick-starting critical relief and protection operations, Ukrainians received food, shelter, medicines, psychological support, household and farming supplies – and cash to buy the essentials for their families.</p>
<p id=""""><em>Household supplies and cash in Kharkiv</em></p>
<p id=""""><em>‍</em>Kharkiv was one of the worst affected cities: nearly a third of the people displaced in Ukraine are from the region. For those who stayed, the situation was dire.</p>
<p id="""">In May 2022, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), with funding from CERF and others, distributed critical supplies like solar lamps, mattresses, blankets, and hygiene supplies. “Only war-affected people can understand the value of this aid,” said Serhii, the head of local NGO Source of Revival, which is an IOM partner. The NGO brought supplies to Nadia, living on the outskirts of provincial capital Kharkiv, after fleeing shelling in the town of Derhachi shortly after discovering she was pregnant.</p>
<p id="""">“There is nothing left alive in Derhachi,” she recalls. “There is shelling here, but not as fierce as in my hometown. When a missile hit a nearby school, we had to move again.”</p>
<p id="""">CERF also helped fund UNICEF cash assistance in Kharkiv and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p id="""">""I saw a publication about UNICEF's financial assistance on social media and applied,"" says Venera, who fled with her husband and two-year old son Makar and had been struggling to afford the basics. ""In three weeks, about 20,000 UAH was transferred to my account.""</p>
<p id="""">The cash meant they could pay rent and buy medicine, diapers and food – as well as some simple toys for their son, who has Down’s Syndrome. “The money helped us to survive a few months,” says Venera.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">Food security for the winter</em></p>
<p id="""">CERF money helped Ukrainian households plan for the winter, funding the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and its partners to distribute seeds, vegetable production kits, animals and cash. Seed distributions in May meant farmers – and homestead gardeners – could harvest before the winter.</p>
<p id="""">“It's absolutely crucial to help farmers. The big ones but also the small ones, and families involved in backyard farming,” said Pierre Vauthier from FAO Ukraine. “Agriculture is one of the major sectors in Ukraine’s economy and it’s important for the country’s food security. It is also a key source of income for the 12.6 million people who live in rural areas, and make up almost a third of the country’s population.”</p>
<em id="""">Mental health support and medicines</em>
<p id="""">CERF and the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) worked in concert to respond to the crisis, providing psychological aid and medical supplies.</p>
<p id="""">Access to mental health services is critical during a conflict, but people might not be able to leave their homes or neighbourhoods safely or even know where to go. In June and July, with funding from the Pooled Funds and other donors, UNFPA and their local partners mobilized over 100 mobile teams of psychologists and social workers in cities and communities across Ukraine.</p>
<p id="""">Hundreds of medical facilities have been destroyed or damaged during the war. In November, the World Health Organization (WHO), with funding from CERF, the UHF, and other donors – was able to bring life-saving medical supplies into Kherson days after the Government of Ukraine regained control of the city.</p>
<p id="""">“These supplies will save lives and help ensure that the health system is resilient and can continue delivering care in these challenging circumstances - and support hundreds of thousands of people,” said Dr. Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">Food for people on the move</em></p>
<p id="""">Maksym, Anastasiia and their child fled their home in Donetsk in March – and were living hundreds of kilometers away in Dnipro. Far from family and friends they were very worried about money. A third of Ukraine families is food insecure; and that figure rises to half of families in some eastern areas. Some 40 per cent of people surveyed said they were reducing meal sizes, with adults eating less to prioritize their children, or having to borrow food.</p>
<p id="""">The World Food Programme (WFP), with the support of CERF and other donors, reached people in frontline areas where fighting is going on, with boxes packed with staples like meat, rice, pasta and oil. “With WFP assistance, at least we don’t worry about the food,” Maksym says.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">Cash assistance gives people flexibility</em></p>
<p id="""">CERF funding also supported cash aid, through IOM and other partners, from the very start of the crisis.</p>
<p id="""">“I find this cash helps better than other kinds of assistance because you know what you need most and your needs change,” says Valentyna, 64. She used money from IOM to purchase medicine and treatment for her glaucoma which she wouldn’t have been able to afford otherwise.</p>
<p id="""">As 2023 begins, some 17.6 million people need humanitarian assistance. Across the country, peoples’ homes and critical civilian infrastructure have been destroyed. And as Ukrainian civilians deal with the impact of the continuing conflict, more will need to be done to help them.</p>
<p id="""">Continued support to the Central Emergency Response Fund will ensure people in need receive that help.</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Ukraine, Dnipro.</strong> Yulia fled bombs in Lysychansk with her daughter Alisa. They arrived at a collective shelter in Dnipro. “On 29 March, a bomb fell near our house… all we could bring was a pram for Alisa and two bags, one with clothes and the other with nappies. We don't have anything else here.”</p>
<p id="""">A single parent, Yulia managed her household alone back home. But the war presented new expenses and challenges. “In Dnipro, I used to spend UAH 15 (roughly half a dollar) per day for a large bottle of water. You may not think it's that much money. But if you take into account all the monthly expenses, it really is,” says Yulia.</p>
<p id="""">Life in the shelter isn’t easy. “We were the first to arrive and it was difficult getting to know people here. But now we all know each other; there are always children playing together,” explains Yulia, sitting in the small bedroom where she sleeps with Alisa and her mother.  The walls are covered with pictures of her time in Dnipro. “We couldn’t take any photos with us from home, so I’ve taken as many as possible to make new memories.”</p>
<p id="""">Things changed when the International Organization for Migration (IOM) – with funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and other donors - installed a water treatment unit at the centre to provide safe drinking water.</p>
<p id="""">This simple change brought freedom and comfort. ""Alisa and I can drink when we want to; we can make tea, wash our vegetables, etc. Before I had to walk long distances to buy the jugs, often in the rain or heat, but now I just need to step out of the room,” says Yulia.</p>
<p id="""">IOM’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene programme will also provide a washing machine, hygiene kits and other items for the people now living in the centre, and make small repairs to the kitchen and showers.</p>
<p id="""">Life is not as comfortable as back home, where Yulia ran a small clothing store, but her priorities are clear. “We are now preparing for the school year. That’s our main concern. We know it will be online, but we’re still waiting for more information.”</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk.</strong> Since the war started in eastern Ukraine in 2014, older residents have been among the most vulnerable. When other family members flee, elders are often left alone and struggling.</p>
Even before February 2022, one third of Ukrainians trapped by the conflict in eastern Ukraine who needed assistance were over 60. As the war escalated elsewhere in Ukraine after the invasion in February 2022, the ‘People in Need’ NGO continued to support people in the east, as they had been doing consistently for eight years.
<p id="""">With funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) and other donors, ‘People in Need’ (PiN) organized assistance, including water, food, and hygiene items, delivered by train from the Czech Republic to Dnipro and then onward by trucks or vans driven by local partners including ‘Right to Protection’ and the Ukrainian Red Cross.</p>
<p id="""">PIN’s long-term partner in Ukraine, <a id="""" href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-war-older-people-ukraine-and-everywhere-else"">HelpAge International, conducted a survey</a> at the beginning of March 2022 and found that 99 per cent of older people in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts had no plans to leave. For many, mobility difficulties mean leaving is impossible, many do not have family nearby to help, and most cannot even reach local shelters.</p>
<p id="""">Older people said they remain at home when fighting is going on outside because they don’t want to be a burden, they want to protect their homes, or because they have already moved many times before.</p>
<p id="""">""The biggest worries are that with more fighting, more elderly people will be left behind, isolated and in urgent need of food, water and health and mental health support,"" warns Petr Drbohlav, HelpAge Regional Director. With UHF funding, PiN and other partners have been able to continue providing vulnerable older people with much needed support.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Ukraine.</strong> OCHA's pooled funds – the Central Emergency Response Fund and the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund - have worked together since the war began to deliver life-saving help to people in desperate need.</p>
<p id="""">The war has brought death, injury, mass displacement, destruction of infrastructure and housing, and deprivation. The number of people in need of humanitarian aid and protection increased from approximately 3 million people at the start of the year to nearly 18 million a few months later. In the 2022 Flash Appeal, humanitarian organizations asked for nearly US $4.3 billion to reach people affected by the war.</p>
<p id="""">The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the UN's emergency fund, allocated over US$60 million from February, making Ukraine the largest CERF recipient in 2022. The first allocation, for $20 million, was made on the very first day of bombing, on 24 February, to allow agencies to rapidly scale up life-saving assistance and protection to people affected by the escalating war.  This helped UN agencies quickly scale up their cash, in-kind and protection assistance for vulnerable people inside Ukraine and in neighbouring Poland and Moldova, while also enhancing the humanitarian community logistics and telecommunications capacity.</p>
<p id="""">The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) has been funding local and international NGOs and UN agencies, including in areas affected before February 2022. On 1 March, the UHF allocated over US$40 million to help its partners quickly scale up relief work across Ukraine – including mobile health care, trauma and psychological first aid, water delivery and temporary shelter, as well as cash grants. Donations increased, and the total funds from UHF this year rose to over $192 million disbursed to 56 partners across Ukraine. The UHF made it easier for existing partners to change their projects to address the rapidly changing needs – and fast-tracked eligibility requirements for new partners, so that more people could be reached.</p>
<p id="""">The humanitarian community used both Funds to reach people in need.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">Essential supplies and mental health support</em></p>
<p id="""">The city of Kharkiv suffered badly, and CERF and UHF funding to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) allowed their local partner, Source of Revival, to deliver thousands of solar lamps, blankets hygiene kits, mattresses and other supplies for people displaced by the fighting.</p>
<p id="""">Psychosocial support is as critical as basic supplies. Mobile teams supported by funding from CERF, UHF, and other donors were deployed by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) throughout Ukraine to serve people affected by the conflict.</p>
<p id="""">""We strive to provide emotional, physical, legal protection and comfort for each survivor. Our mobile teams are premised in local communities, where the need for services is the highest,"" said Mustafa Elkanzi, UNFPA Senior Emergency Coordinator in Ukraine.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">Adapting quickly as the situation changes</em></p>
<p id="""">As the situation evolved, money from CERF and the UHF allowed humanitarians to adapt and respond. In Kherson, the World Health Organization (WHO) – supported by CERF, UHF, and other donors – delivered medical supplies to the city less than 72 hours after it was re-taken by the Government of Ukraine, in November 2022.</p>
<p id="""">""These supplies will save lives and go towards ensuring that the resilient health system can continue delivering care in these challenging circumstances and support hundreds of thousands of people,"" explained Dr. Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine.</p>
<p id="""">As 2023 begins, some 18 million people need assistance. The OCHA-managed pooled funds will continue to support humanitarian organizations delivering essential supplies and services for the most vulnerable people across Ukraine.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Yemen. </strong>“This kit really came on time and has helped us to eat and dress, as we lost everything we had,” says Eman, who lived through flash floods. She had already sold most of her possessions to flee conflict, and now, her family had lost what little they had.</p>
<p id="""">Eight years into the conflict, Yemen is in a severe humanitarian crisis, and over 21 million people need assistance. In early 2022, fighting in Ma’rib and Shabwah displaced thousands more people. In April, flash foods ravaged parts of the country—including people already displaced by the fighting.</p>
<p id="""">Funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund supported families affected by flooding and conflict with Rapid Response kits containing essential supplies.</p>
<p id="""">The floods were a terrifying experience for people living in displacement camps.</p>
<p id="""">“The sky was full of clouds, then, suddenly, heavy rain washed away our shelters. Everything we owned – personal documents, blankets, food – it was all destroyed,” describes Qubool, who lives with her children in Baga camp. She fled fighting in January only to lose her few possessions to the terrible rains.</p>
<p id="""">The floods affected more than 300,000 people, many of whom, like Qubool, had already fled violence.</p>
<p id="""">To help people displaced by the floods, UNFPA led a multi-agency Rapid Response Mechanism with UNICEF and WFP.  The emergency kits, funded in part by the YHF, provided clothing, soap and sanitary pads, jerry cans and read-to-eat food for up to seven days: in other words, the basics to help families at least through the first few days.</p>
<p id="""">It’s not always easy to distribute the kits, especially in hard-to-reach areas. “We face many challenges, but the main one is that rough trails make it difficult to reach the newly displaced families, and we don’t always know where these families are,” says Anas Abdullah Al Moalimi, from IOM.  “There are many displaced people and families. Some fled without a thing, they could hardly survive, and they had nothing except for a few blankets they got from their neighbors.”</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Ukraine, Lviv.</strong> Svitlana fled intense shelling in her hometown in the east and made for Lviv in the west. Thousands of others came with her, seeking shelter and safety.</p>
<p id="""">A retired teacher, Svitlana found herself with a new voluntary job: transforming a college dormitory into a shelter for people displaced by the fighting. The dorm was originally built for 600 students, but could accommodate 1,000 people with some adjustments. Facilities were run down and needed repair.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and the Danish International Development agency, the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) has been repairing the dormitory and helping Svitlana prepare for more families to move in safely.</p>
<p id="""">“We are slowly making progress and take more people in whenever and wherever we can,” said  Svitlana during a recent visit. “We have managed to create room so far for a little over 400 people, and more are coming as we get the work done,’ she explained.</p>
<p id="""">Each room now houses, on average, three people, and for every eight rooms – meaning 24 people – there is now access to one shower. Racing against time, Svitlana oversaw repairs to broken windows before the winter set in.</p>
<p id="""">Asked about a typical day, Svitlana explained that there is no longer time to rest and that she has to deal with everything from counselling people to distributing food to finding more space for new arrivals. She said she worked from five in the morning until midnight each day.</p>
<p id="""">“Sometimes, the most important thing is to just listen to people and let them share their grief and their individual stories – and the suffering seems to know no limits,” she said.</p>
<p id="""">Amid fear and suffering, life goes on. “So far, we have had four weddings in the shelter, and a baby was born here recently,” said Svitlana proudly. A kindergarten has been set up, run by the internally displaced people themselves. Local citizens donated toys and furniture.</p>
<p id="""">Svitlana continues to oversee the work to improve and expand space in the dormitory. For many others, the future remains uncertain.</p>
<p id="""">Katerina fled Luhansk with her two children and is now staying temporarily in Svitlana’s dormitory. “I’m planning for today and maybe for tomorrow, but beyond that I don’t know.

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Yemen.</strong> Over two million children are out of school in Yemen because of poverty, conflict, or lack of resources. More than a third of the schools are damaged or otherwise unfit for learning. Even when schooling is available, resources are severely lacking, and teachers are frustrated.</p>
<p id="""">Funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund supported access to better quality education for the most vulnerable children.</p>
<p id="""">""I've been teaching first- and second-grade students for nearly eight years,” says Sawsan Ali Hussein, an elementary school teacher from the Sarar district in Abyan governorate. “We used to follow outdated teaching methods based on rote learning, which involves just memorizing and repeating information to many students crammed in a small classroom. The younger children used to get frustrated and struggle in this environment. I tried to upgrade my teaching skills to provide better education and psychological support for my students, but I didn’t know where to start.”</p>
<p id="""">Sawsan was one of sixty teachers and administrators who received training on modern teaching methods, and on psychosocial support through a YHF-supported CARE International project. Her school also benefited from newly constructed classrooms.</p>
<p id="""">With her new skills, and some new materials, Sawsan was seeing a difference in her students, “Using interactive teaching methods and the materials in the recreational kits has helped students develop their vocabulary and reading fluency.""</p>
<p id="""">Tamdeen Youth Foundation and CARE International - with YHF support - rehabilitated five schools that serve conflict-affected families and their host communities. The project bought children essential school supplies – backpacks, notebooks, pencils and the like. It also trained teachers in new skills and psychosocial support.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Ukraine, Kharkiv. </strong>The World Health Organization reported there had been more than 260 verified attacks on health facilities, 100 days into the war in Ukraine. There has been substantial damage to Ukraine's healthcare infrastructure.</p>
<p id="""">With funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, UNOPS procured over 100 diesel electric generators and worked closely with the Ministry of Health to identify and deliver them to the hospitals and clinics that needed them the most.</p>
<p id="""">Generators are critical to ensuring people in Ukraine can get the health care they need since they provide hospitals with an independent source of energy if they are cut off from the national grid.</p>
<p id="""">“The generators we received from the United Nations will allow the operation of two hospital buildings at once,"" noted Dmytro Dmytryshyn, Deputy Chief Physician at Svitlovodsk Central District Hospital, which received two generators. ""This is extremely important for maintaining our energy stability, especially under martial law conditions.""</p>
<p id="""">The Emergency Aid and Disaster Medicine Centre in Kharkiv is the central ambulance operational centre, dispatching around 200 ambulances in response to calls from the public across the province.</p>
<p id="""">Viktor Zabashta, the Centre’s director, explained that they received three generators. “One of them has been stationed at the Centre, while the others have been allocated to our ambulance stations. Uninterrupted electricity supply is key to our work: we need a power source to support our dispatch services, the Telecard system for gathering cardiographic data and GPS tracking for calls and vehicle movement, as well as communication between the central office and the ambulance teams. Much of the equipment we use is electrical and needs to be recharged regularly – that’s what the ambulance station generators allow us to do.”</p>

<p id="""">It’s especially difficult in rural areas. In 2022 Majani, 20, was pregnant for the first time. She lives in a remote part of Al Shihr district, where the nearest health centre is a difficult journey away.</p>

She was able to get psychological support through protection services offered by the Human Access organization, with funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund.

<p><strong id="""">Ukraine, Kharkiv</strong> – Oleksandr and Venera rent a small room in a hostel in Kharkiv's suburbs. Amid the devastating war in Ukraine, their priority has always been their two-year-old son Makar, who has Down's syndrome. After losing their jobs because of the war, hope has been in short supply.</p>



<p>Now a cash assistance programme from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) means they can once again work towards building a better future for him.</p>



<p>When the war broke out, the family hid in a basement. As the shells exploded, Oleksandr and Venera tried hard to stay calm so that Makar would not be scared. Oleksandr lost his job in construction soon after. Overnight, the family found themselves struggling to afford the basics.</p>



<p>In March 2022, UNICEF launched a joint humanitarian cash assistance programme with the Ministry of Social Policy. The programme is supported by donors including the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and aims to help families with children who are worst affected by the war in Ukraine.</p>



<p>""I saw an article about UNICEF's financial assistance on social media and applied,"" says Venera. ""In three weeks, about 20,000 UAH was transferred to my account."" The money helped the family pay rent and buy medicine, vitamins, diapers and food. They also bought Makar some toys.</p>



<p>""The money from UNICEF helped us to survive a few months,"" adds Venera. In six months, Makar will turn three and start a course of developmental classes with specialists.</p>



<p>By the end of 2022, 200,000 families in Ukraine had received cash transfers, amounting to US$ 191 million. This means that over 560,000 children have been helped, including 50,000 children with disabilities.</p>

<p id="""">In Sirwah area, Al-Raql Health Center had to close six years ago because of the fighting. Most of the people the health centre served had already fled their homes. And the center’s closure meant people were unable to receive medical services or easily access essential medicines.</p>
<p id="""">Economic collapse, increased poverty and the breakdown of national social protection systems are all consequences of this drawn-out conflict. And basic services for people from the public health system are inadequate across the country, limited by damaged infrastructure, or  lack of critical supplies and staff.</p>
<p id="""">In January 2022, the Relief and Development Organization - with funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund - responded by implementing a joint health and nutrition project for the most vulnerable people in the area served by Al-Raql.</p>
<p id="""">At the same time, the project funded repairs to the health center’s damaged buildings, medical equipment and furniture, and a new waste disposal incinerator, which is essential for safe operations. Health services became operational again by July 2022, and now the project is treating almost 50 patients a day with different health needs, and Al Raql Health Center is again able to serve this community.</p>

<p id="""">She has been living in Nouna since insecurity forced her to leave her village in western Burkina Faso. The commune, home to some 15,547 IDPs, is located in the Boucle du Mouhoun region, which hosts 72,961 IDPs – 19.82 per cent of them women and 57.47 per cent of them children.</p>
<p id="""">With growing demand on  scarce water resources, many hosts and IDP households have difficulty accessing drinking water. According to a needs assessment conducted by Help and its partners in December 2021, more than 50 percent of the population in Nouna have difficulty accessing water, travelling  long distances and enduring long waits to obtain the precious resource.</p>
<p id="""">Accessing drinking water is all the more difficult for  people with reduced mobility.  ""Before Help's support, life was an ordeal for my children and I ­­– problems with food, water, and money. For example, to get drinking water, we had to go to the fountain 2 km away and pay 25 CFA francs per 20-litre can,” says Mrs. Dio.</p>
<p id="""">To ensure equitable and safe access to drinking water in this emergency context, Help trucked in water for 6,085 IDPs (3,061 women and 3,024 men). Each person received at least 7.5 litres of water a day for 30 days. Beneficiaries were targeted in an inclusive manner, taking into account gender and disability, among others.</p>
<p id="""">In addition, awareness sessions on water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) and gender-based violence (GBV) have already reached 6,200 people (3,210 women and 2,990 men).</p>
<p id="""">These actions were carried out thanks to the Multi-sectoral Humanitarian Assistance Project for IDPs and host households in the communes of Bomborokuy, Nouna and Tougan, in the Boucle du Mouhoun region. They were implemented by Help and operated by the WU PAKUWE association, while the  Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa (RHFWCA) provided US$783,500 in financing.</p>
<p id=""""><em id="""">""</em>I benefited from the support of Help and its partners in September 2022 during the free distribution of drinking water and it relieved me a lot, even if only temporarily. There were also sensitizations on hygiene and cleanliness. All this helps us to preserve our health,"" Mrs Dio said. “The water distribution allowed me to save the money I used to pay for water and to direct it towards another expense, in this case, to pay for food, even if it is not a large amount. The advice on hygiene also allowed me to clean up my living environment and to avoid certain diseases that could cause additional or unexpected expenses,"" she added.</p>

She attended several training courses and became a consultant in the Immunization Programme, funded by the GAVI alliance and the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). She stresses the importance of training health workers on preserving vaccines, giving advice to beneficiaries, archiving information, collecting data, and submitting monthly reports. “Vaccination is important to protect children from the diseases that have spread recently such as pertussis, diphtheria, polio, and measles,” she says.</p>
<p id=""""><strong id="""">Vaccination saves childrens lives</strong></p>
<p id="""">""I participated in the training course to enhance my skills and knowledge of immunization,” says Rowaida Al-Aqili, an immunization officer at Al-matar health center, in Marib. “Science evolves rapidly, so it is important to keep up with any new updates in this field to provide better immunization services to beneficiaries,” she explains.</p>
<p id="""">""The training covered the theoretical and practical aspects of vaccinating children as well as preparing monthly reports of the used vaccines and the number of vaccinated children. I learned how to calculate and use graphs to illustrate the monthly and cumulative percentage of unvaccinated children and immunization coverage,” Rowaida adds. ""We save children’s lives through vaccination; we protect them from deadly diseases and raise caregivers’ awareness about routine vaccinations,"" she emphasizes.</p>
<p id="""">Many fatal child diseases have re-emerged as a result of the conflict and the deterioration of health services in Yemen. ""The prevention of diseases lies in immunization, so we encourage parents to vaccinate their children against deadly diseases. It is also important to raise awareness and dispel rumors about the vaccine's safety through media,” Rowaida explains.</p>
<p id="""">“Health workers face challenges with the delay in vaccines arrival and some parents’ reluctance to vaccinate their children,” she highlights. ""However, acquiring these new skills will improve the quality of work and help us provide better immunization services,” she clarifies.</p>
<p id=""""><strong id="""">New skills and knowledge</strong></p>
<p id="""">""This training is very important, as we need to improve health services quality,"" says Awad Muhammad Al-Kharraz, a health worker at Al-Hadba Health Center in Al-Wadi, Marib. ""I learned new concepts about immunization in addition to the proper storage and administration of vaccines,"" he explains. ""The vaccines are safe, and they curb the spread of diseases and reduce mortality rates among children and women,” he adds.</p>
<p id="""">""Many children are not vaccinated because some families refuse to vaccinate them; they are not aware of the vaccine's safety and of the danger of these diseases,"" Al-Kharraz explains. For this reason, educating people about these diseases and the benefits of vaccination will help increase health awareness in the community. ""This training has enriched my knowledge of immunization and basic primary health care. It helped me overcome the challenges I face at the health center,” he concludes.</p>

report,published,1,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"Cash assistance helps vulnerable families during the winter months","Syria | 2022 | CERF
<p id=""""><strong id="""">Syria, various locations.</strong> “We have no cash, no food, and no furniture,” says Khitam, from Suran village in Rural Hama. The ongoing crisis in Syria left over 14.6 million people in need in 2022, most of them women and children. Conflict and economic collapse have contributed to rising food insecurity and financial hardship. Almost 80 per cent of people reported that they could not meet their basic needs.</p>
<p id="""">‍
UNICEF, with CERF funding, aimed to reach 350,000 vulnerable people with clean water, nutrition, education and protection support, including cash to help families cope at critical times of the year.</p>
<p id="""">‍
During years of displacement due to fighting, Zahira and Ismail struggled to make ends meet. After moving back home, Zahira noticed that her three daughters – Hala, Reem and Ithraa – were all shorter and smaller than their peers in school. She took them to a nearby UNICEF-supported health centre, supported in part by the Central Emergency Response Fund.</p>
<p id="""">‍
The girls were diagnosed with malabsorption, difficulty in digesting or absorbing nutrients from food. Reem and Ithraa received medicine to support their growth. “There were days when we had nothing to eat but bread. The girls’ poor diet probably led to this,” said Zahira.</p>
<p id="""">‍
The family also received cash to help buy critical supplies for the winter. The winter assistance provides cash to families living in cities with children during the winter.</p>
<p id="""">‍
Khitam, in Suran, faced rising rent for her home even as the school year was starting, with all the associated expenses. US$60 in winter assistance helped her kids be ready for the new term. “I was so relieved when I received the cash. It came exactly on time! I bought my children new stationery and new clothes for school. Also, I bought food and stored it for emergencies,” said Khitam.</p>
<p id="""">‍
Siboha, also in Suran, is using the cash payment to start the first phase of treatment for her son Hamzah, who has a neck injury that needs surgery. “I dreamed of taking Hamzeh to a dermatologist. Finally, we are here! I want Hamzeh to restore his self-confidence and feel included. This wouldn’t have happened without the cash assistance,” explained Sobhia.</p>

report,published,1,2,1,4597,267,8,1503,12353,"CERF funding provides a lifeline to Yemenis during a devastating year","<p id="""">Yemen | 2023 | CERF</p>
<p id=""""><strong>Yemen.</strong> Yemen faces one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises. Over 21 million people will need humanitarian help in 2023.</p>
<p id="""">The 2022 humanitarian appeal received over US $2.2 billion in donations, allowing humanitarian agencies to reach 11 million people across the country. Thanks to this donor support, humanitarians could stave off the worst last year.</p>
<p id="""">Funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the UN’s emergency fund, was a critical part of this – not least by jump starting response following new displacements in Ma’arib to reach over 430,000 people with assistance.</p>
<p id="""">CERF funding came through two allocations: a Rapid Response  allocation of US $20 million to respond to new displacements in and around Ma’rib, allowing for a quick scale up of response when needs were high; and a further Rapid Response  allocation of US $20 million for economic disruption, including to sustain health services during a period of increased need.</p>
<p id="""">Conflict has devastated the country’s infrastructure, especially in high-risk areas like Ma’rib,"" Dr. Loay Mohamed Sulaiman, the director of Kara general hospital,  explained. CERF funding supported a WHO-administered feeding center at the hospital.</p>
<p id="""">“The urgency and severity of health needs of internally displaced populations have pushed the operational capacities of our health facilities to their absolute limit…gaps in support affect the services we provide to a large extent,” Dr. Sulaiman added.</p>
<p id=""""><strong><em>Mobile clinics for the newly displaced, and infrastructure support to hospitals</em></strong></p>
<p id="""">With CERF funding, UNICEF could fund mobile clinics and health teams to offer health and nutrition services to people newly displaced in Ma’rib, as well as to host communities.</p>
<p id="""">The clinics meet a variety of needs, says Dr. Abdullah Al-Wahashi, a general physician. “[They] offer immunization services, reproductive health services, prenatal care, and therapeutic feeding services for malnourished children,” he explains.</p>
<p id="""">CERF funding supported critical nutrition surveillance and support. In Bayt Al-Faqih, Hudaydeh, Saeeda took her baby girl, Jouri, to the clinic, which is supported by CERF and other donors through UNICEF. It was Jouri’s fourth visit to follow up on her severe acute malnutrition.</p>
<p id="""">A health worker at the clinic, Hana’a, said she sees about 80 children a day. Thankfully, Jouri is doing well with treatment. She’s gaining weight, and her mom brings her each month to check on her and get therapeutic food.</p>
<p id="""">Funding for health and nutrition services such as these is important, as 540,000 children in Yemen risked losing their lives to malnutrition in 2022.</p>
<p id="""">CERF funding supported the World Health Organization to respond in 6 districts in Ma’rib, after the new displacements and a sudden disruption in basic health care. Even as demand for hospitals and clinics increased, the money ensured medical care and nutrition services remained available.</p>
<p id="""">The money went to incentive payments for surgical staff and was also used to purchase six ambulances. The project provided fuel as well, to ensure the hospitals could operate effectively.</p>
<p id="""">CERF money responded quickly to displaced populations in and from Ma’arib, and provided crucial help to support the health system through a surge in demand.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Burkina Faso</strong>. With humanitarian needs increasing in the central Sahel, the Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa (RHFWCA) has allocated US$20 million to support NGOs in Burkina Faso to respond to the most critical challenges in hard-to-reach areas, where people urgently need WASH, protection, food, and shelter support.</p>
<p id="""">Burkina Faso faces a multidimensional crisis. Some 3.5 million people – one-fifth of the population – need humanitarian assistance. The conflict has worsened vulnerability due to climate change-related drought and flooding. With the added effects of COVID-19, some 2.9 million people were severely food insecure in 2021.</p>
<p id="""">This recent allocation targets the areas of Boucle du Mouhoun, North, Sahel and East on the borders of Mali and Niger, also known as the Liptako-Gourma region; as well as the Center-North and Center-East regions. The funding will support the delivery of an integrated package of assistance for people affected by  conflict, food insecurity, and malnutrition in a context dramatically affected by climate change.</p>
<p id="""">Thirty-four projects are approved for funding to reach some 850,000 people. National NGOs will receive $3.8 million in direct funding to implement eight projects, with INGOs receiving the remaining $16.2 million. $3.4 million of this will be sub-granted to local and national organizations. Many of the NNGOs are smaller, community-based organizations critical to ensuring community engagement, acceptance, humanitarian access, and more importantly, accountability to the affected population.</p>
<p id="""">“We are pleased that this allocation will support so many local organizations, who will ensure that we can reach communities we otherwise would not be able to,” noted RHFWCA fund manager Olivier Nkidiaka. “Through the Regional Fund our partners will have the resources to help them reach a significant portion of Burkina Faso’s most vulnerable people as they deal with multiple crises.”</p>

<p id=""""><strong><em>Donetska and Luhanska, Ukraine. </em></strong>Since the invasion of Ukraine began almost five months ago, Andrii and his colleagues from the Ukrainian NGO Proliska have put their lives on the line to bring a glimmer of hope to people caught up in the fighting in the east.</p>
<p id="""">Under the constant threat of shelling and air strikes, Andrii risks his life to drive a minibus through mined roads and over destroyed bridges to evacuate people from the heavily affected Donetska and Luhanska oblasts.</p>
<p id="""">He told us that he encounters danger every time he embarks on an evacuation mission. “Often, I have to stop because of shelling and wait on the road for an hour or two before it becomes quieter, and then I can drive again,” he explained.</p>
<p id="""">On some occasions, shelling starts just as people are about to board the bus.</p>
<p id="""">“It happened to us in Siversk, Donetska oblast, at the beginning of May,” said Andrii. “We had to hide and wait to be able to proceed. That day a residential building was hit, and when we went out of the basement of the school many people realized that they no longer had a place to go. Some came with us the same day.”</p>
<p id="""">Despite these challenges, Andrii and other drivers from Proliska have helped 5,300 civilians caught up in the fighting in the east to evacuate to safer areas.</p>
<p id="""">This life-saving work is funded by the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, thanks to our donors’ support.</p>
<p id="""">Proliska’s remarkable work provides a clear picture of how this war is not only making life unbearable for millions of people but also imposing enormous obstacles for those trying to help them. People in Ukraine have now endured almost five months of a ferocious war, with no guarantees of being able to safely leave areas under constant attack. They are often without food, water, medical care, power or gas to cook or heat their homes.</p>
<p id="""">The United Nations is tirelessly engaging at the highest levels with parties to the conflict to guarantee safe passage for people who want to leave and for humanitarians to deliver the assistance that people in Ukraine desperately need.</p>

<p id=""""><strong>Yemen, Taiz and Al-Bayda governorates. </strong>When the nearest place to get clean water is far away, it’s a challenge for children like Amal, who lives in Al-Mukha, Taiz. As the eldest child it was her responsibility to get water for the household. Making it to school every day wasn’t possible. “I don’t want to waste my time waiting in lines for water, but it’s my responsibility,” she says.</p>
<p id="""">Eight years into the conflict, Yemen is still in severe humanitarian crisis, and more than 21 million people need assistance. Basic service delivery across the country is inadequate, and about 17.8 million people lack access to safe water and adequate sanitation services.</p>
<p id="""">Because of the conflict, it’s difficult to buy fuel, which in turn, has limited the delivery of safe water to households. Many water pumps in Amal’s village were out of order due to the fuel shortages. And water trucks are beyond most families’ budgets.</p>
<p id="""">The situation was similar in Al-Sawadiya district – where people were forced to rely on expensive water trucks or rely in part on unsafe open-surface wells, because of the scarcity of water.</p>
<p id="""">A reserve allocation of $2.58 million was made by the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, specifically to support WASH activities in this deepening water crisis.</p>
<p id="""">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), with the support of the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, implemented a water project in Amal’s village, in Al Mukha. NRC built a 50,000-liter water tank with a solar powered water pump. NRC built 10 water points across the village, so that people didn’t have to travel long distances.</p>
<p id="""">Now Amal can manage to get the water home and make it to school on time. “I don’t take all of the heavy jerry cans, and my hands don’t hurt anymore,” she says.</p>
<p id="""">Meanwhile, in Al-Sawadiya, Yemeni NGO NFDHR constructed a similar water tank with a solar pump, and installed water pipes to supply the eight villages most in need of water. Residents there also commented that their children can now attend school more regularly, instead of spending the school day standing in line for water.</p>

<p><strong>Ethiopia and Somalia.&nbsp;</strong>“I have never seen this kind of drought in my life,” says Mohammed, who lives in Garbo, a town in Ethiopia’s Somali region. “I thought it was just an old wives' tale my grandfather used to tell me. Now it is my reality.” Mohammed is a pastoralist who had to leave his home in the village of Seeley. The drought killed all his livestock in 2022, so he was forced to move to Garbo. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Horn of Africa is experiencing the most severe drought in recent history, following four consecutive failed rainy seasons in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, a climactic event not seen in 40 years.</p>



<p>Humanitarian organizations estimate that more than 2,200 people have migrated to Garbo in the last five years, with more coming all the time as the drought made earning a living with animals almost impossible. Halimo had a similar story to Mohammed. “I lost all my livestock,” she explains. “We survived, but we lost our livelihoods.”</p>



<p>In neighbouring Somalia, Agbal faced a similar situation, forcing her to make an almost impossible choice. A mother of nine, she and her husband were constantly on the move in search of work, leaving the children with family members back home. “When it became hard to get by, I left my baby at home to earn a living,” she explains, noting she had to stop breastfeeding him and rely on others to bottle feed him.</p>



<p>Across Ethiopia and Somalia hundreds of thousands of people are on the move because the drought is making their livelihoods impossible. Part of a broader regional drought across the Horn of Africa, it drove millions of people to move and seek support in 2022.</p>



<p>With support from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the International Organization for Migration provided drought-affected people in Garbo with cash assistance. Each of the nearly 2,000 households displaced across 18 villages in Garbo received the equivalent of USD 167, to help them with the basics.</p>



<p>Cash assistance is flexible, because it provides a lifeline and allows people to choose what they need to help them get back on their feet. Halimo and Mohammed also found new ways to earn a living and support their families. Mohammed has opened a tea shop. Halimo is delivering water to her neighbours, using a donkey she bought with the help of cash aid.</p>



<p>Back in Puntland, Somalia, Agbal brought baby Cahdi to a WFP-supported health center when she saw he was unwell, and he was able to get the help he needed. CERF funding supported nutrition help for Agbal’s baby and thousands of other affected children, as well as direct food assistance for 4.7 million people.</p>



<p>CERF allocated US$65 million in 2022 so that UN agencies could deliver immediate food, health, logistics, protection, shelter, and water and sanitation assistance. This included allocations for Ethiopia ($12 million), Djibouti ($2 million), Kenya ($10 million), and Somalia ($41 million) (more information on&nbsp;<a href=""https://pfdata.unocha.org/?fund=cerf"">CERF DataHub</a>). The Ethiopia and Somalia Humanitarian Funds respectively allocated $22.5 million and $54.8 million to scale up their drought response, focusing on enabling local and national partners to reach people in the hardest-to-reach and least served areas.</p>

<p><strong>Lebanon, Beirut.</strong> Sana, a 32-year-old mother of two, says Lebanon's devastating economic crisis has taken a heavy toll on her family life. She has been unsuccessful in finding work to support her family. She blames the economic crisis - which has left about a third of the population unemployed - as well as her partial hearing impairment.</p>



<p>Suffering from severe mental health issues following the economic crisis and unable to earn a living, in 2022 Sana sought help at a CERF-funded safe space provided by UNFPA. After attending multiple sessions, Sana was able to speak out openly about her mental health issues and economic concerns. ""I became less worried and felt more capable and confident,"" she said.</p>



<p>CERF funding enabled UNFPA to support two safe spaces in northern Lebanon that promote women's empowerment, and prevent and respond to GBV. The centres provide comprehensive services for 4,500 vulnerable Lebanese and Palestinian refugees.</p>



<p>Sana was also given cash assistance to support her family. ""This month, I was finally able to buy vegetables and ingredients to prepare their favorite meals,"" she said, adding that she was able to pay for educational support for her children. ""It is a heavy weight off my shoulders knowing that I am at ease with my family,"" Sana said.</p>

<p><strong>Afghanistan, Paktika province.</strong> On 22 June 2022, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan’s Paktika and Khost provinces at about 1:30 am local time. The quake was felt as far away as Pakistan, India and Iran. More than 100,000 people needed emergency humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of the quake.</p>



<p>Among those affected by the earthquake was Mohammad Gul, a resident of Gayan District in Paktika. He experienced devastating loss as both his wife and baby niece were killed in the quake, and his daughter Bakshoba was severely injured the next day, in an aftershock.</p>



<p>Bakshoba received emergency trauma care. An International Medical Corps ambulance arrived and took her to the nearby trauma center where she was treated alongside many other injured people.</p>



<p>Her father was able to take her for follow-up care for her injuries, as well as for psychological support to help deal with the trauma of the earthquake. “Our community is in a very distant part of the province,” explains Mohammed. “What would have happened to us if this clinic had not been here?”</p>



<p>Thanks to the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund's support, International Medical Corps has been able to provide earthquake-affected communities in Gayan District with critical resources including medicines, ambulances, and a dedicated team offering trauma care and psychosocial support.</p>

<p>DRC | 2022 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Democratic Republic of Congo, Lolwa. </strong>People in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have suffered through a complex crisis driven by chronic violence, sexual violence and grave violations against children that has now lasted decades. Across the country, 26.4 million people – or one Congolese in four – are severely food insecure. And 5.7 million people are internally displaced, the highest number on the African continent. Millions of people seek safety and security away from their homes.</p>



<p>Noe, 59 and a father of six, fled his village because of militia fighting. He found refuge in Lolwa, Ituri province, where he is president of the displaced persons camp, elected by the other families living there and by the host community.</p>



<p>Caritas Bunia, a Congolese organization, provided cash transfers to 2,250 displaced people and local families in Lolwa, with the support of the DRC Humanitarian Fund in 2022. This was the first assistance received in Lolwa, where the project estimated some 7,000 households were seriously affected by the crisis. With cash transfers, people can purchase the basics they need. As Noe notes, “Today, each household has been able to buy the household items of their choice.""</p>



<p>Household supplies for families<br>Clementine is a young mother of five. She and her family fled violence in late December 2022, arriving at Rusayo IDP camp with very little. “We fled with only our clothes. When we arrived at Rusayo, we were given space for a small hut. When it rained, water leaked.” The family gathered what basic items they could from neighbours.</p>



<p>With support from the DRC Humanitarian Fund (DRC HF), local Congolese NGO RACOJ is assisting around 22,000 displaced families with shelter and household supplies. Clementine and her husband received the basics like blankets, tarpaulins, cooking pots and utensils. “One of the things we needed most was better shelter and basic household items. These items will help us a lot.”</p>



<p>Over 45 per cent of DRC HF funding went to Congolese organizations in 2022, putting localization at the heart of its mission. Local organizations are often the best placed to understand the needs of their communities and are accepted as partners offering help.</p>



<p>Clementine hopes to return home. “This is not a way of life, and it hurts me to be dependent on assistance for survival today. We used to live a better life before. I wish to return home, but we will only do so once it is safe.”</p>

<p>Ethiopia | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Ethiopia, Somali region. </strong>Communal conflict has twice displaced Nimo and her family. The conflict, which flares up between two clans quite often, results in displacement, destruction of livelihoods and even death.</p>



<p>In 2018, Nimo and her family were forced to flee their home in Jina’sani (Chinaksen), leaving behind the family farm that had provided them with a stable livelihood.</p>



<p>Fleeing on foot, Nimo and her family left everything behind. After a perilous journey, they arrived at the Qoloji displacement camp in Fafan Zone, which hosts over 16,000 households and is the largest displacement camp in the Somali Region.</p>



<p>Without a home and away from the farm, the family struggled. ""Seeking a better situation, they were once again displaced and moved to Tuli town displacement camp in Tuliguled Woreda, north of Jigjiga city, the Somali regional capital. In Tuli, they received limited assistance, like occasional food aid and plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, but they were living in extremely difficult conditions.</p>



<p>“We used to share the most basic household items with our neighbours who also had very little. We would wait for them to finish cooking and then use their pots and plates,” explains Nimo. “We tried to borrow some items from shop owners in the town, but they do not trust you when you are an IDP and do not have any resources or money.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, an emergency shelter project run by ZOA provided cash assistance to over 1,400 households, enabling them to purchase essential household supplies.</p>



<p>Nimo said that she used the money to buy pots, plates, cups and other essentials. “I don’t have to go round to our neighbour and beg for her pot or cups now – I have a feeling of freedom.”</p>

<p><strong>Central African Republic, Bocaranga. </strong>In Bocaranga Hospital in the country's west, mothers sit by their children's bedsides with worried faces. One of the children is Christel, who is 5 years old. His mother, Victorine, explains, “He was very sick. I brought him for a consultation three days ago. The doctor diagnosed malaria and since then we have been here for treatment.”</p>



<p><em>A major public health challenge</em></p>



<p><em>‍</em>In the Central African Republic (CAR), the under-five mortality rate is the fifth highest in the world (113 children per 1,000) according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). &nbsp;Malaria is the leading cause of death among children under five and a major public health concern, particularly during the rainy season - April to September - when the number of cases increases.</p>



<p>“In 2022, we saw over 1,000 sick children and more than 60 per cent were suffering from malaria. Cases are recurrent and constitute the main pathology diagnosed in the region,” explains Dr. Osias Yandi, Bocaranga Hospital’s most senior doctor.</p>



<p>CAR's fragile health system has suffered many shocks in recent years, including the resurgence of armed violence, structural challenges and the effects of COVID-19. With 120,000 residents, the Bocaranga district has one of the few hospitals in the region. About 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line. For Victorine and many people like her, it's difficult to access health services. “I don’t have formal employment. That’s why I started treating my son’s illness with traditional plants – I don’t have any money. My neighbour told me about free healthcare at this hospital.”</p>



<p>The CAR Humanitarian Fund supported NGO Doctors with Africa to offer malaria treatment and other free health services. Christel was able to receive free treatment, and his mother got more information on preventing malaria. &nbsp;And, to help even more people, with the support of the World Health Organization, CAR has begun introducing malaria vaccines into the national immunization programme.</p>

<p><strong>Iraq, Hatra. </strong>Under the hot sun, Mishan carefully soldered the edge of an oil drum. Nearby, his brother worked with an angle grinder, sending the sound of screeching metal around the courtyard.</p>



<p>Mishan gestured to the arch-covered garage opposite, and led us through the twisted debris into the shade of the arches. From the other end of the passageway one of his employees was hammering sheet metal. “This is the quiet part of the workshop,’ Mishan said, laughing.</p>



<p>Mishan founded his workshop with cash assistance from People in Need, funded by the Iraq Humanitarian Fund. With the money he received, he purchased the initial tools and scrap iron necessary to build his business. “So many people benefitted from PIN’s project, and I was one of them. It helped me a lot. With the first round of cash assistance I was able to pay off my debts, and with the money left over I bought the materials and essentials for my workshop,” he said.</p>



<p>With the cash he continued to receive from PIN, Mishan was able to save some money. “For now, I don’t have a house of my own. I live with my family,” he said, “I’m trying to save money so I can buy a house.” He raised a finger and tapped the top pocket of his overshirt. “I keep my savings right here,” he added.<br>Mishan called his son over and rested his arm over the boy’s shoulder. “I’m married and I have four children, with another one on the way, so of course we need a house!”</p>



<p>Mishan is one of several people in Hatra who benefitted from PIN’s cash assistance programme.<br>“The cash helped me a lot,” he said. “Without it, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything. I could barely pay my bills before, but now all I think about is buying our new home.”</p>



<p>With the flexibility of cash, people facing a crisis can prioritize their own assistance. For Mishan, that meant paying down debt and investing in workshop tools. The assistance allowed him to start saving and planning for the future, for himself and his family.</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Akkar. </strong>Moussa, 24, was born with paraplegia. Paralysis below the waist affects his legs and hips. Moussa lives in Akkar, North Lebanon with his mother and sisters. Until recently, their home lacked special adaptations that would help make his life easier.</p>



<p>Life is not easy right now. Lebanon has been experiencing a severe economic crisis since 2019, resulting in a widespread deterioration of living conditions, with many families struggling to make ends meet and unable to afford basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. &nbsp;Akkar is an agricultural area that has been deeply affected by Lebanon’s ongoing economic crisis. Life is even harder for Moussa’s family, as they struggle to find decent jobs.</p>



<p>With funding from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, local organization Nusaned made improvements at Moussa’s house to make his life easier. This included weather-proofing the doors, windows, and ceiling to withstand the cold winter conditions. In addition, an accessible bar was installed in the bathroom.<br>“This makes a big difference to my independence,” Moussa explained. &nbsp;And his whole family will be healthier with these improvements before the winter.</p>



<p>In Lebanon, people with disabilities like Moussa are particularly vulnerable, as they often face additional barriers to accessing services and opportunities. Nusaned’s project supports 700 families like Moussa’s with food vouchers, water and sanitation supplies and shelter rehabilitation in six villages in Akkar District.</p>

<p>Nigeria | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Nigeria, Adamawa state.</strong> Ibrahim Agah, 65, has lived in what was supposed to be ‘emergency shelter’ in Malkohi, in north-east Nigeria’s Adamawa State, for almost a decade.</p>



<p>In 2013, he and his wife Hadiza sought refuge in Malkohi with their three children following a Boko Haram attack on their village. Boko Haram set fire to all the houses. The family fled into the darkness with nothing but their lives. They hid in the wilderness before travelling to the relative safety of Malkohi.</p>



<p>After nearly a decade in temporary housing, Ibrahim and his family will again have a home to call their own. Through a durable solutions project run by the International Organization for Migration, with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund, they will live in one of 215 newly constructed shelters, with private latrine and showers. Solar streetlamps and portable household solar lanterns will provide lighting, and there is easy access to the market, school and the health centre.</p>



<p>The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) is supporting similar projects elsewhere. In neighboring Labondo, 37-year-old Hauwa and her daughter sell home-cooked food to support their family. Hauwa says it has not been easy to provide for her children since she was widowed years before. Hauwa and about 450 other displaced and vulnerable families will benefit from new shelters provided through a pilot UNHCR project, also supported by the NHF.</p>



<p>The aim of durable solutions is to take a ‘big picture’ look at what vulnerable people need for their well-being. This might include shelter, livelihoods, water, sanitation and hygiene, or safety, education, health care and more. NHF funds durable solutions with the aim of supporting displaced people so that they can resume their lives and livelihoods, and move on from temporary assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Occupied Palestinian Territory, Northern Gaza</strong>. Rajab, a 13-year-old boy from northern Gaza was in the sixth grade when he started helping his father at work by collecting plastic to recycle. Determined to support his family, Rajab, who had nine siblings to care for, including two brothers with disabilities, found himself struggling academically.</p>



<p>With conflict escalating, a lack of mental health services, and poor school infrastructure – as well as underlying poverty – the dire situation in the Gaza Strip limits children's access to education. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To address pressing educational challenges for vulnerable children in the North of Gaza Governorate, in 2022 the Palestine Save the Children Foundation ran a project 'Ensuring Quality and Inclusive Education for Vulnerable Children.' This initiative, funded by the occupied Palestinian territory Humanitarian Fund (oPt HF), provides school-based catch-up classes and psychological support sessions to out-of-school children and those with disabilities.</p>



<p>Through this program, Rajab was given the opportunity to enhance his academic skills. He hadn’t been enjoying school, but with the support of the project's teachers, psychologist, and his mother, Rajab was successfully reintegrated back into school.</p>



<p>His commitment to attending the catch-up classes Arabic, English, and Math was unwavering, and he quickly became more confident and engaged in the lessons and activities, including drama, drawing, role-play, and fun days with his peers. “The unique teaching methods, and regular follow-up visits, along with his own school bag and stationery, have really motivated Rajab's commitment to education,” said Rajab’s mother Samar.</p>



<p>Today, Rajab is back in school, eager to learn and build a better future for himself and his family. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Burkina Faso |2022 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Burkina Faso, Est region.</strong> Conflict in Burkina Faso since 2015 has upended the lives of displaced hundreds of thousands of people in Est region. But, even as life slowly returns to normal, one danger they continue to face is the risk of improvised explosive devices and landmines.</p>



<p>They ruin lives long after active fighting is over – children on their way to school, adults taking care of the land to grow food and earn a living can find their lives ruined in an instant, by stepping into the wrong place or playing with the wrong object.</p>



<p>One way to reduce the danger is to improve information and understanding, especially with children and their mothers. Knowing what to look for, and what to do if a device is found, can save lives.</p>



<p>“It's critical that communities take ownership of risk education,” said Michel Ouoba, a programme officer with national NGO Association Tin Tua.</p>



<p>Local NGOs know the community best, so they are best placed to lead in helping to educate people about risk and how to be safe. The OCHA-managed Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa funded Association Tin Tua, a local NGO, in partnership with the Danish Refugee Council (DRC).</p>



<p>With Association Tin Tua as the lead partner, the consortium is providing various kinds of help for people with food security, child protection and - the principal component - mine protection activities in Diapaga, Pama, and Matiacoali communes in Est region.</p>



<p>These activities prioritize reaching women and children with the information they need to stay safe, and how to educate others about the risk.</p>



<p>The partnership exemplifies the localization approach in effectively reaching crisis-affected people.<br>Association Tin Tua has a history in the region, and the partnership with Danish Refugee Council allows ATT to bring their detailed local knowledge to communities, and DRC to ensure best practices in risk education.</p>

<p>Somalia | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Somalia. </strong>Garaad Abdi Haji is a father of five living in the Nasteexo displacement camp. He and his family fled Ethiopia after the unprecedented drought that continues to devastate the region killed most of his animals and destroyed the farmland they depended on to survive. Like many, they had nothing left.</p>



<p>Living conditions in Nasteexo are not easy, and people don’t have money to spare. Mercy-USA, with support from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, built several safe water points and improved sanitation facilities for better living standards.</p>



<p>“I have a hard time putting food on the table so providing more than that is beyond what I can do. This latrine has made a big difference to our daily life here in the camp. Before this, we had to go outside the camp, and it was risky to do this after dark, especially with small children,” says Garaad. “Now we don’t worry about leaving the camp at night. It’s something neither I nor my neighbours could have built ourselves.”</p>



<p>Accessible latrines are equally important for the elderly and people living with disabilities. Mohamed, 45, recently lost his mother. She was his sole caregiver and he now lives alone. “This latrine is installed to accommodate my needs,” he said. “I can shower on my own, and the chair is comfortable for me,” he explains.</p>



<p>The Somalia Humanitarian Fund has provided critical funding to several water and sanitation projects, to help people in crisis live safely and with dignity.</p>

<p id=""""><strong id="""">Somalia. </strong>In Somalia, drought and hunger continue to affect 7.8 million people. Over 1.9 million people have left their homes in search of food, water, and livelihoods.</p>
Some 1.8 million young children are at risk of severe malnutrition and related health complications. That is over half the children in the country – and over half a million already qualify as severely malnourished.
<p id="""">With funding from Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the WHO is providing essential lifesaving health care services in 31 hard-hit districts across the country.</p>
“CERF funding has certainly helped us keep morbidity and mortality to a minimum, but with …increased displacement….our planned targets are becoming bigger by the day because of the increased demand both at health facilities and outreach sites across the country,” said WHO’s Khalid El-Tahir, who is leading drought response activities.
<p id="""">“It’s time that the world should open up their coffers to help Somali people cope with one of the worst droughts in more than a decade,” he added.</p>
Since July 2022, WHO has used CERF funding as a catalyst to spearhead health interventions, reaching over 720,000 people with emergency health care services. CERF funds have been used to buy and distribute essential medical lifesaving equipment, medicines, and supplies to 57 health facilities, including support to 7 laboratories with essential items for timely disease testing and tracking.
<p id="""">Under the ongoing CERF-funded interventions, WHO has deployed vaccinators and community health workers across 31 drought-affected districts and have reached over 7 million at-risk people with preventive health interventions, including basic vaccinations for children, and Vitamin and nutrition supplementation for children at risk of malnutrition.</p>
<p id="""">Such support is critical.</p>
<p id="""">“If the situation is not addressed the future of Somali children is jeopardized as stunting in children is associated with an increased risk of mortality, [and] reduced cognitive development,” warned WHO Somalia’s Health Operation Manager, Simon Kaddu Ssentamu.</p>

<div class=""wp-block-column"" style=""flex-basis:66.66%"">
<p><strong>Nepal.&nbsp;</strong>Nepal is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The yearly monsoon floods affect more and more people, driving displacement, food insecurity and disease. Economic losses can reach hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>



<p>Sarita and her family were badly affected back in 2017. “My first daughter was one month old at the time. We lost almost everything, but we survived by running away from the house. Each year, we struggle to survive the floods,” she remembers.</p>



<p>In 2022, humanitarian agencies in Nepal used new tools to act pre-emptively based on predictions and forecast data - before the floods began - to help vulnerable people living in the Karnali river basin. Laying the groundwork in 2021, OCHA worked with the United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office, World Food Programme, UN Women, UNFPA and the German Federal Foreign Office, to develop the Nepal Anticipatory Action framework.</p>



<p>The aim was to trigger assistance based on warnings of potential floods, so that people would receive aid earlier. This would minimize the damage to communities, and prevent negative coping strategies like skipping meals or reducing meal size. Cash assistance alongside psychosocial support would improve the protection and health outcomes.</p>



<p>Activating action before the floods<br>With warnings of heavy flooding in targeted districts of Kailai, Bardiya and Banke the ‘readiness phase’ was triggered on 2 October, and agencies geared up their planned interventions. On 7 October, when forecasts triggered the ‘action phase’, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) authorized three UN agencies to spend $3.2 million to support communities ahead of peak flooding.</p>



<p>The World Food Programme, UN Population Fund (UNFPA), and UN Women distributed cash and essential supplies like food, clothes, and solar radios to vulnerable communities. They shared forecasts as an early warning of what to expect, and offered psychosocial and legal support services.</p>



<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/WFP_Nepal/status/1590642704970821632"">Bhagiram Sunaha</a>&nbsp;was one of 15,000 families who received anticipatory cash assistance, which gave them the flexibility to buy food, make repairs, and get supplies ahead of the floods. “I will spend the money on clothes, repairing my boat, salt and oil,” he said.</p>



<p>Sarita, the woman who remembered fleeing with her baby daughter in 2017, received cash and essential supplies from UNFPA’s distribution in 2022. “With the money, I’ll buy some rice and food for my family,” she said.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><em>How people felt it worked &nbsp;</em><br></strong>Initial monitoring showed that&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/WFP_Post-distribution%20monitoring_Nepal%20AA_2022.pdf"">people used about a third of the cash they received for purchasing food</a>&nbsp;– and the earlier they received assistance, the better their food security after the event. And people appreciated the UNFPA/UNWomen ‘Cash+’ modality, where they got a mixture of cash and in-kind aid. &nbsp;The various food and basic items were useful even beyond the crisis event.</p>



<p>Overall, over 95% of respondents said they were satisfied with this help from the United Nations. They also mentioned how the UN can do better in the future, like making assistance easier to access; better integrating local knowledge, and linking up aid to long-term investments.</p>



<p>For many people, information was an important part of the assistance. People who received anticipatory action support were more likely to have had an early warning about the floods than other people. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Amrita Kami, living in Bardiya district, described how “3-4 days earlier, we got the message that there will be floods. When we got the message, we took our animals and tied them to a raised embankment. We built a temporary shelter…and stayed there for some time,” she said.</p>



<p>They also had time to pack their food supplies and store them in a safe place. “Thanks to the alert message, we were able to read it and know when the flood will hit us. We were well prepared for the floods.”</p>

<p><strong>DR Congo, Rutshuro.</strong> Alice fled with her children when fighting broke out in Bugina, a village located several hours’ walk away from Rutshuro, where she now lives. More than 190,000 people were forced to leave their homes following the clashes in North Kivu province. </p>



<p>Families lack food, water, adequate shelter, health care, and sanitation services. The clashes are only the most recent in a conflict that has upended many lives for decades.</p>



<p>Alice is filling a water jug to take home, outside the Remera primary school in Rutshuro.</p>



<p> “Life is very difficult here,” says a student, Mani, who is washing some dishes nearby with the clean water.</p>



<p>At Remera primary school UNICEF quickly established water points so that children and their families had sustainable access to clean water. Since March 2022, UNICEF has also constructed 272 toilets and 132 emergency showers in places hosting displaced families. The funding, from the Central Emergency Response Fund, is part of OCHA’s pilot anticipatory action project for cholera.</p>



<p>Without access to clean water and sanitation services, children and families are exposed to a higher risk of waterborne diseases, notably cholera. UNICEF distributed prevention kits to 3,500 displaced families and trained over 40,000 people in good hygiene practices, thanks to support from USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), CERF, and the Governments of Japan, Germany and Sweden.</p>



<p>“We know we need longer-term investments in water and sanitation to put cholera behind us,"" says Juan Chaves-Gonzalez, who is leading the pilot. ""While that happens, we need to get ahead of it so that in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, catching and controlling a small cluster of cases can avoid a crisis. That’s what anticipatory action for cholera is all about.”</p>



<p>CERF allocated US $750,000 for anticipatory action for cholera response in DRC in 2022, to support UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and their partners to mitigate cholera and prevent a larger outbreak. Improving detection and confirmation of cases, interrupting transmission, and promoting safe hygiene packages are also critical.</p>



<p>“When I arrived I had no water,”says Mani, at the school’s water point. “It is difficult to live without water.”</p>

<p>South Sudan | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>South Sudan, Ganyiel.</strong> “I decided to lead by example,” Tabitha says. As a member of the mother-to-mother support group in Ganyiel, she wants her neighbours to understand how her children benefit from her improved kitchen garden.</p>



<p>Not only do her kids get access to a more diverse diet – making them healthier, stronger, and less likely to suffer from malnutrition – but Tabitha is also earning extra income selling the extra food.</p>



<p>The peer learning approach, part of a project implemented by the International Rescue Committee in Ganyiel, has improved the nutrition of vulnerable children, and kickstarted improved household food production. It also represents a more sustainable approach to addressing malnutrition before children are in crisis.</p>



<p>The food security situation for many South Sudanese remains precarious, affecting two-thirds of the country’s people. Between April and July 2022, some 7.74 million people - or 63 per cent of the population - were estimated to be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (also officially described as Phase 3 or higher in the integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC).</p>



<p>The project, supported by the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund, puts affected people at the center of the solution. Tabitha is one of eighty mothers who are part of the peer support programme. They are promoting breastfeeding and early child nutrition, and encouraging women to start kitchen gardens to improve their nutrition diversity, a key part of combatting childhood malnutrition.</p>



<p>The aim of this intervention is that people learn from each other, and are able to improve their livelihoods as well as longer-term nutrition outcomes. Tabitha has been able to grow enough food for her family, and earn extra money from selling the excess. “I make some income from the surplus,” she explains. Her garden has become a learning ground for other women in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, South Kordofan state.</strong> In 2022, nine-year-old Mahasin was displaced with her family, including her five siblings, after fighting erupted in South Kordofan State. Mahasin’s father was a farmer and the family provider, but he lost his income due to being displaced from their land and home.</p>



<p>Mahasin had never been to school before – she spent her time helping her mother at home. She tried to enroll in a school in their new settlement, but classes were already full. In Sudan, schools are often overstretched, with up to 80 students in one class. Educational infrastructure in host communities is often unable to accommodate the additional children from displaced families.</p>



<p>After her first disappointment, Mahasin heard from other girls about the Accelerated Learning Programme (ALP) for children who had missed out on school. The programme is funded by the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, and implemented by Save the Children.</p>



<p>Mahasin was eager to start studying. &nbsp;“I inquired how I could register, and the teacher asked me if I had ever studied before,” she explained. “I told him that I had never visited a school, even though I was 9 years old. He enrolled me in his class straightaway.”</p>



<p>She began studying Arabic and maths. ""I'm very happy that I am able to go to school now and to study with my new friends, whom I met during the programme,” she said. “Also, there is a good learning environment because of the new tables, benches, stationery and school bags.""</p>



<p>Mahasin is studying hard because she wants to become a doctor to help others. ""When I go home, I revise my lessons with my sisters and help my mother in my spare time. In school, I like to do jump rope with my friends,” she said. “I'm so happy that I’ve learned how to write and calculate. Now I can write my name and a lot of other things."" Her parents are very proud of their daughter.</p>



<p>The emergency education component in South Kordofan is funded by the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, and implemented by Save the Children. The consortium project with Goal and Almanar Voluntary<br>Organization (AMVO) has provided more than 10,000 children with teaching and learning materials, seating for 550 students, handwashing facilities and water sources for 20 schools, and training for 58 headmasters and teachers.</p>

<p><strong>Syria, Quneitra governorate</strong>. Twenty-eight-year-old Mariam smiled as she opened the door to her home: ""Finally, someone new has come to visit."" While it was cold outside, she settled in with a visitor to chat next to the house’s warm heater.</p>



<p>Mariam, her brother Ahmad and wife and children were displaced for five years, but have recently been able to return to their village of Um Batna in Quneitra Governorate. Although they were happy to come back, they were heartbroken to see the damage their house suffered during the war. Another sibling provided them with a place to stay until they made the needed repairs to move back safely into their original home.</p>



<p>Mariam has cerebral palsy. It affects her speech and cognition. The displacement, and the deaths of her elderly parents in recent years have affected her a lot, too. Her brother Ahmed is working two jobs to support the family – on a farm, and in a sweet factory. She lives with him and his family.</p>



<p>One of the family’s biggest challenges is preparing for the cost of surviving the winter comfortably and healthily. Diesel isn’t available in the market so they rely on firewood to heat the house. &nbsp;ZOA organization, with support from the Syria Humanitarian Fund, provided the family with a heater as well as olive pomace to fuel the heater, as well as warm clothes for the children. Ahmed explained this help was essential for the family’s comfort, health and safety last winter.</p>

<p><strong>North-west Syria</strong>. For Feda, a displaced mother in Al Bab, the floods and snow last winter were devastating. It took three days to empty the water from her home and dry her furniture and belongings in the sun.</p>



<p>Displaced Syrian families like Feda’s have raised concerns – as reported in an OCHA Community Voices bulletin – about the cold and damp conditions as well as the lack and space and privacy in camps. For ten years, Feda and her four children have lived in the same tent, far exceeding the six-month lifespan of an emergency shelter.</p>



<p>After over a decade of war, 800,000 people are living in tents in north-west Syria, often in overcrowded conditions. As Feda’s friend Yazi puts it, “Living in a tent is like living on the street. If there is rain outside, there is rain inside as well.”</p>



<p>Shelter needs make up the bulk of winter and flood preparedness response in north-west Syria. In 2022, over half the funding requirement was dedicated to shelter and basic household terms, for 2 million people. &nbsp;And to prepare for winter, people needed clothes, blankets, ground insulation and stoves are needed for safety, comfort and dignity - and to reduce the risk of fire from people gathering closely for warmth.</p>



<p>In March 2022, the humanitarian community launched the Action Plan for Dignified Shelter and Decent Living with the aim of replacing nearly all tents in the north-west. The plan made a case for the urgent need for dignified shelters, noting their value for money given its privacy, durability and structural integrity for harsh winter conditions compared with tents. The Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF) funded the action plan.</p>



<p>Feda and Yazi were among the families who benefitted from the initiative. They and the children moved into one of 400 new buildings in Al Braziyah Al Jadaad camp, built by local organization BINAA with support from the SCHF.</p>



<p>“I felt such relief. There is no mud or dirt, and it did not feel cold. It feels like a home,” Feda said. Each housing unit has a sturdy door, lighting, a sink with water and individual toilets. “I can finally put my head on a pillow and sleep,” said Yazi. She added that feelings of “privacy and security” are what she most appreciated at the new housing.</p>



<p>Other challenges remain for the two women and their children. Food, health care and job opportunities are absent from the new camp so far. The closest health center is five kilometres away, and the affordable market where they prefer to buy bread is even further.</p>



<p>But with support from the Syria Cross-Border Humanitarian Fund, local NGOs like Binaa are on the front-lines of responding to people’s humanitarian needs. In 2022, the Fund allocated 42 per cent of its total allocation – some 59.2 million dollars – directly to local organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine, Kherson. </strong>Kateryna woke up to the sound of explosions on 24 February 2022 at her home in Kherson. The city was suddenly on the frontline following Russia’s invasion. Kateryna’s eldest son Danylo, 12, and her months-old baby, Malina, were with her.</p>



<p>That morning, when Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, Kateryna’s husband and 7-year-old Anna, who is disabled, were visiting Poland to seek specialized medical treatment for her. Kateryna called her husband. “I begged my husband [that we should] go anywhere, just not to stay here. There was only one thing in my head: save the children, take the children away from here.”</p>



<p>With her husband and Anna already in Poland, it was up to Kateryna to flee with her oldest son and the baby. It was winter, but Kateryna did not have a chance to pack warm clothes or take any other belongings with her, as they had to leave as soon as possible.</p>



<p>As she watched her elder son’s mental health deteriorate, she knew it was time to go. Danylo, who is usually very sociable and always optimistic, had what the doctors described as an epileptic attack after witnessing the shelling and hearing the constant blaring of sirens.</p>



<p>The family finally reunited in western Ukraine, and a week later decided to leave for Romania. That’s where they encountered Save the Children, an NGO that responded to the needs of displaced people and refugees in and out of Ukraine, with funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF).</p>



<p>The organization provided Kateryna and her family with much needed help, including backpacks, food, and cash assistance totalling UAH 80,000 (approximately US $2,300) – to help them get on their feet in Romania.</p>



<p>Six months later, the family decided to return to Ukraine and registered as displaced people in Chernivtsi, a city far from the fighting. Save the Children staff invited Kateryna and her family to register for cash assistance in their new city. With some of the cash, Kateryna bought Anna a wheelchair as hers had become too small and uncomfortable for her.</p>



<p>“Thank God, Save the Children helped us buy this wheelchair, which Anna will be able use for the next five years,” Kateryna said. Before February 2022, Anna had attended a regular kindergarten in Kherson and could socialize with other children. Unfortunately, there is no such an opportunity at present, and Anna really misses it. &nbsp;“Our life has changed completely. We have never wanted to live abroad: we hope to return home to Kherson soon,” she said.</p>

<p><strong>Venezuela, Caracas.</strong> In La Vega, a parish in western Caracas, fourth-graders play in an enclosed parking lot next to their school, with a view dominated by mountains. The playground has new swings and slides that they love to play on.</p>



<p>The playground in La Vega is one of five sites built as part of the ""Peace takes over the neighborhood"" project, implemented by Cooperazione Internationale in 2022 with their partner Caciques Alzaos, and with the support of the Venezuela Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>""This project came to us about a year ago. It really has had a great impact because La Vega was struggling with delinquency in some areas here in the parish,"" explains Viani Galarraga, a community leader who has lived in the area for 16 years.</p>



<p>Next to the playground is another open space that is attracting community attention, where basketball and football teams can practise. ""After nine years, we have a football field again. It's so exciting, there are even kids from other neighborhoods who come to take pictures,"" says Galarraga.</p>



<p>""Peace takes over the neighborhood"" included individual and group protection support provided by psychologists, training in livelihoods and safe spaces in two communities affected by armed clashes in the Capital District.</p>



<p>The project reached more than 5,500 people in these two neighborhoods, 72 per cent of whom are women, children and adolescents; while 7 per cent are people with disabilities.</p>



<p>""Before the project started, the community was indifferent, and people would not leave their homes,"" says Dayana, a resident of Cota 905. She supports pregnant and breastfeeding women from one of the rehabilitated spaces, and together with her ""girls"", as she calls them, they joined the vocational training offered by this initiative.</p>



<p>Dayana proudly explains that she now has her certificate in making Creole sweets, which she hopes to turn into a business soon. She hopes that the mothers she brought to the training have already started their own.</p>



<p>Julio*, a young man from Cota 905 who took part in phone repair and hairdressing training, agrees with Dayana. He says the project had ""a great impact because it was necessary. Since we had to stay at home, we weren't doing anything else,"" fearing that something might happen out on the street.</p>



<p>The vocational training offered Julio useful skills for his future, and also served as a stepping-stone. Today, he works with the foundation that started the project in his community. He says that he and his friends are practising what they have learned.</p>



<p>""A friend of mine has his own barber shop. And, as we have learned here, we help those who really need it. If someone with little money comes in and needs the service, he gives him a shave, anyway.”</p>



<p>“Don't stop doing this, because you are helping a lot of people,” says Julio about the vocational training.</p>

<p>Yemen | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Yemen.</strong> The Yemen Humanitarian Fund has established a feedback hotline to ensure that people receiving humanitarian assistance can easily raise any issues and have confidence that their concerns will be addressed.</p>



<p>The call center has four hotline operators – two men and two women – who receive calls from 8am to 8pm daily, except Fridays. Calls can be made by phone, SMS, or via WhatsApp message.</p>



<p>Upon receiving a call, the hotline operator logs the issue into the system and sends a confirmation message to the caller, assuring them that their complaint has been recorded and is being processed. The implementing partner then receives a message outlining the complaint. The partner takes necessary actions to address the raised concern and maintains communication with the hotline, providing updates on the progress made.</p>



<p>One day, the hotline received a call reporting that the Mukhlaq Health Center, supported by the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, was not providing medicines needed by the community, including essential antibiotics and anti-hypertensives.</p>



<p>The Mukhlaq Health Center, located in Al-Abdiyah district in Marib, serves over 2,500 displaced people in the surrounding area.</p>



<p>Working collaboratively with partners in the Health Cluster, the Yemen Humanitarian Fund assessed which medicines were available at the health center. Doctors told the mission that there was a real demand for the antibiotics and anti-hypertensives that the caller had mentioned, but that they weren’t included in the standard package provided by the Health Cluster.</p>



<p>“These community hotlines help us be accountable and transparent, and help us adapt the program based on the real needs of affected communities,” explained Dr. Fawaz Ghalib, Health Cluster coordinator for Marib.</p>



<p>To address this gap, the medicine package was revised for Mukhlaq Health Center. The hotline team contacted the person who originally made the phone call to let him know that the medicine would now be available. “I’m grateful for the attention you gave my complaint,” he said.</p>



<p>An effective humanitarian system recognizes and ensures that affected individuals are the first responders and active participants in their own relief efforts during emergencies and subsequent recovery.</p>



<p>Through Accountability to Affected People initiatives, humanitarians ensure that their programs remain relevant and effective. The Yemen Humanitarian Fund’s hotline is a prime example of putting community feedback at the center of adapting and improving the quality of humanitarian response.</p>

<p>Honduras| 2023 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Honduras, Puerto Cortés. </strong>Dr. Alba Rita Sámbula heads &nbsp;the Bajamar Health Centre, which serves about 11,000 people. In November 2020, the devastating storms Eta and Iota that hit the region, severely affecting her community. It submerged the health centre under water, damaging the facilities and compromising the health of staff and patients.</p>



<p>The water had destroyed medicines, stretchers, files, vaccines and essential medical equipment. The roof of the building had completely lifted off, “revealing an unhealthy state due to its age and the presence of pigeon droppings, posing a health risk to staff already suffering from respiratory diseases,"" said Dr. Sámbula.</p>



<p>Baja Mar is an Afro-descendant Garífuna community in the department of Cortés, located in an area of high vulnerability to flooding due to the impact of meteorological events. Located 30 minutes from the city of Puerto Cortes, its streets are made of dirt, which makes access difficult during the rainy season.</p>



<p>With many unmet health needs in vulnerable municipalities affected by multiple crises, a Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) project intervened in the Bajamar Health Centre during 2022 and 2023 as well as other health facilities in Cortes and three other affected regions, in order to ensure availability and continuity of healthcare services.</p>



<p>Dr. Sámbula became the main promoter of the changes needed to improve conditions at the health centre. Thanks to CERF project funds, the external infrastructure of the building was restored. Toilets for patients were built, providing greater comfort and privacy.</p>



<p>In addition, the roof of the facility was completely repaired. Not only were the problems caused by the storms solved, but significant improvements were made to the structure, including cleaning up the pigeon-related damage.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But the improvements were not just limited to the physical infrastructure. Dr. Sámbula and her team also received new medical equipment and supplies, ensuring that they could provide quality care to patients. In addition, the health centre was painted and renovated, creating a more welcoming and dignified environment for both staff and patients.</p>



<p>The benefits of these interventions were immediate and noticeable. Health workers were able to work in more suitable conditions, which had a positive impact on their health and well-being. The risk of respiratory illness due to exposure to an unsanitary ceiling was eliminated, resulting in a lower rate of absenteeism and an increase in the quality of care provided.</p>



<p>Patients also benefited from access to cleaner and safer facilities, resulting in greater confidence in health services and a better overall experience. Dr. Sámbula and her team felt reinvigorated and motivated to continue providing quality care to their community.</p>

<p><strong>Burkina Faso, Kaya. </strong>Pamoussa Sawadogo is the head nurse at a clinic in Kaya, capital of the Centre-Nord region. The clinic has long suffered from water shortages due to the violence and conflict affecting basic services throughout the region.</p>



<p>Kaya, a city about 100 km northeast of Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou, has seen large numbers of internally displaced people arrive since 2019. Insecurity and violence by armed groups have affected many people caught up in the conflict.</p>



<p>Pamoussa explained, ""This issue really affected the maternity ward. After a woman had given birth, it was difficult to clean the room properly. We regularly had to bring in water from public fountains just to ensure minimal hygiene in the ward.""</p>



<p>The nurses were even paying from their own pockets to ensure the clinic was kept properly clean.</p>



<p>Since December 2022, the clinic has a new water pump, thanks to a project run by the national organization Technical Assistance Alliance for Development (ATAD), and funded by the Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa.</p>



<p>As Pamoussa put it, the water pump has helped meet the essential need for patient safety. He said, ""Since we got [the pump], it’s been a great relief. The quality of our services has improved because we can now provide our patients with clean facilities. Plus, we no longer have to pay for the cleaning of the facilities ourselves.""</p>



<p><em>Adapted from the original story.</em></p>



<p>Pamoussa Sawadogo, est infirmier-major au Centre de Santé et de promotion sociale (CSPS) du secteur 7 de Kaya, chef-lieu de la région du Centre-Nord. Son centre de santé a connu pendant longtemps un manque en eau du fait de l’insécurité qui affecte la région. « Dans le service de maternité nous étions vraiment impactés par cela. Quand une femme venait d’accoucher, laver la salle afin de la débarrasser de toute trace de sang après était difficile. Nous achetions régulièrement de l’eau dans les bornes fontaines publiques pour assurer la propreté minimale de la maternité. » a-t-il expliqué.</p>



<p>Cependant, depuis décembre 2022, le centre dispose d’une nouvelle pompe à motricité humaine (PMH) grâce au projet de l’Alliance Technique d’Assistance au Développement (ATAD) financé par le Fonds Humanitaire Régionale pour l’Afrique de l’Ouest et du Centre (FHRAOC).</p>



<p>Selon l’infirmier-major du centre de santé, Pamoussa Sawadogo, la pompe à eau est venue répondre à un besoin essentiel d’hygiène au sein du centre. « Depuis que nous avons la pompe, nous connaissons un réel soulagement. La qualité de nos services s’est améliorée parce que nous mettons à la disposition de nos patients des locaux propres De plus, nous n’avons plus besoin de payer nous-mêmes le nettoyage des installations ».</p>

<p><strong>Burkina Faso, Kaya. </strong>Zourata lives at the Tiwega displacement site in Kaya. Kaya is a city north-east of Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou, which has experienced a massive influx of internally displaced people since 2019. Insecurity and violence by armed groups have affected many communities in the region, eroding trust among neighbours.</p>



<p>Zourata is one of thousands who fled violence and came to Kaya with very little.</p>



<p>""When I arrived here, I was traumatized by the violence I had witnessed and the losses I had suffered. I was left with nothing because I couldn't take anything with me when I fled.”</p>



<p>Zourata was able to access mental health assistance and a hygiene kit thanks to a project run by the national NGO Technical Assistance Alliance for Development, and funded by the Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa.</p>



<p>“I met with the psychologist several times individually and in group sessions.” The sessions covered protection as well as social cohesion. “My conversations with the psychologist helped me regain my composure and understand that a different life was possible here,"" Zourata explained.</p>



<p>The awareness sessions on social cohesion have significantly improved the community life for Zourata and her fellow displaced neighbours at the site.</p>



<p>While they were skeptical at first, Zourata and her neighbours now eat together and engage in most of their activities side by side. ""I realized that beyond the day-to-day food assistance, stronger mental health is essential for our survival. Today, I am feeling more hopeful and able to take better care of my younger children who are still with me,"" Zourata added.</p>

<p>Zourata Sawadogo est cheffe de ménage déplacée et mère de sept enfants sur le site des déplacés de Tiwega, dans la ville de Kaya. Elle a bénéficié d'une assistance en santé mentale et d'un kit d'hygiène grâce au projet de l'ONG nationale Alliance Technique d'Assistance au Développement financé par le Fonds Humanitaire Régional pour l'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre. Zourata a tout perdu suite aux violences qui ont éclaté dans le village de Dablo où elle vivait.</p>

Le kit d’hygiène reçu et les séances de sensibilisation de ATAD m’ont beaucoup soulagée. J’ai vu plusieurs fois le psychologue individuellement et en groupe, nous avons été sensibilisés, à la protection et la cohésion sociale. Mes échanges avec le psychologue m’ont permis de me ressaisir et de comprendre qu’une autre vie était possible ici ».</p>



<p>Les séances de sensibilisations sur la cohésion sociale ont considérablement amélioré la vie en communauté de Zourata et ses voisines déplacées sur le site. Méfiantes au début, aujourd’hui elles mangent ensemble et mènent la majorité de leurs activités côte à côte.</p>

<p><strong>Burkina Faso, Kaya. </strong>Kadi (not photographed) a mother of three, left her village when armed men killed some of her family. She came to Kaya with no belongings and no money.</p>



<p>Kaya, north-east of Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou, has experienced huge numbers of internally displaced people arriving since 2019.</p>



<p>With support from the Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa, the local Association Bon Samaritain provides displaced women with a livelihoods support kit – with cash, cooking gas and other supplies.</p>



<p>""I received cash and gas to cook with. I bought utensils and supplies, and used it to sell fried fish. People started appreciating my food, and I built up a clientele! Since I began this business, I feel much better and useful to my family again,"" Kadi explained.</p>



<p>Kadi survived not only war, but also violence from the father of her children. ""He told me that he wished he had married a real woman who could give him sons…""</p>



<p>In Kaya, where she found refuge, conditions were difficult at first. Kadi was subjected to physical abuse when she went out looking for work to feed her children. When her husband left, Kadi began attending awareness and support activities organized by ABSEJ and funded by the Regional Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>""It helped me overcome the depression that was looming over me, and with the support I received for my business, it's as though I have a new life,"" she shared.</p>



<p>Funding has also supported the establishment of ‘vigilance groups’ of men who aim to prevent gender-based violence within the community.</p>



<p>As Souleymane, one member of the group explains, the impact is noticeable and they are able to influence men among the community leadership to end violence and change attitudes. One leader, he said, was against giving cash to women. Souleymane and others argued that it is the women who prioritize cash for the needs of children and family. The chief agreed in the end that cash assistance for women was essential.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, River Nile and Gedaraf</strong>.Children who have fled the fighting in Khartoum have experienced trauma and even after reaching a safer place, they need support to deal with what they have been through.</p>



<p>Since fighting began in April<a href=""https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan"">, about 5.25 million people</a> have fled their homes, with an estimated 3.3 million children now living in displaced locations around Sudan. Hundreds have been killed in the conflict.</p>



<p>In River Nile state, Save the Children, with support from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, is working alongside Sudanese organizations to deliver critical psychosocial care for children, including mental health care and access to child-friendly spaces.</p>



<p>Reem (not pictured), has been attending a mobile child-friendly space, where she can play with kids her age and, as appropriate, speak with a counsellor about what happened to her.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=13kmorhMg4OiV_Dx&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.savethechildren.net%252F&amp;source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjg2NjQsMTY0NTA2&amp;feature=emb_share&amp;v=V4m5rcFk8UI"">Maab Abdelmounim, a Save the Children psychologist</a> working with displaced children in Gezira state, describes what children like Reem are going through: “The children talk. They tell us about what happened to them in Khartoum, what they saw on their journey…” One way to talk about what happened is through drawing. Maab describes another child, who, “on his first day here …drew a military vehicle and wrote ‘Sudan is in danger.’”</p>



<p>In Gedaraf, Plan International is also working to train social workers and volunteers on mental health first aid.</p>

<p>Sudan |2023| CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Sudan, North Darfur, and River Nile state</strong>. Across Sudan, more than 20 million people face acute food insecurity – meaning their inability to get adequate food puts their lives in immediate danger. Hundreds of thousands of malnourished children under five need specialized in-patient care to survive. This already horrifying situation has been made much worse by the conflict that flared up in April. With hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes, the food and nutrition situation is worsening.</p>



<p>With funding from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund and others, the World Health Organization is supporting nutrition stabilization centers across Sudan to treat infants and young children with the most severe malnutrition. WHO has supported 91 stabilization centers with essential medicines, malaria prevention, and critical medical supplies for 26,000 malnourished children.</p>



<p>“Responding to the malnutrition crisis calls for a chain of responses. WHO teams support stabilization centers with medical supplies, training, and oversight; while our health and nutrition partners provide lifesaving special milk and food,” noted Dr. Abdul Baseer Qureshi, WHO Technical Officer in charge of the nutrition programme. “Together, we are working to save lives and ensure the health and well-being of vulnerable Sudanese children.”</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, Central Darfur, and White Nile state</strong>. In conflict and disaster, it is often local organizations who quickly and effectively respond to the needs of their community. &nbsp;Sudan Humanitarian Fund partner HOPE Sudan is one of many such Sudanese organizations.</p>



<p>Since fighting began in April<a href=""https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan"">, about 5.25&nbsp; million people</a> have been newly displaced inside and outside Sudan. They face hunger, a lack of basic supplies, and severe protection risks. Across the country, 24.7 million people need humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p>Central Darfur is hosting about 265,000 displaced people, despite fierce clashes there between Sudan’s warring parties. People who fled conflict elsewhere are living with relatives or within host communities, and basic services – including water and sanitation – are severely stretched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Bindisi and Zalingie, HOPE has been working to improve water and sanitation services so that everyone can access safe water. To identify and respond to problems, they established a complaints mechanisms for the community to use. An important outcome of this has been the protection sessions they have conducted, to raise awareness of risks related to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>



<p>White Nile State is also hosting thousands of people who have fled fighting in Khartoum.</p>



<p>Alongside their work in WASH and protection, HOPE Sudan is providing about 1,000 families there with cash-based transfers. With support from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, people receive cash assistance to help them buy what they need, including food, basic household supplies, or critical medicines.</p>

<p>Nigeria |2023| CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Nigeria, Adamawa state. </strong>Daware town has long been a refuge for people fleeing Boko Haram in neighboring Borno state. After over a decade, about 3,300 displaced people live in the informal camp here.</p>



<p>The villages and towns in this area are easily flooded, causing recurrent displacement and spreading disease from contaminated water.</p>



<p>The lack of clean water and free grazing land drives deep tensions between the displaced community and local herding communities. An older solar-powered borehole – a groundwater well – broke down five years ago and has not been repaired.</p>



<p>Local herders were letting their animals graze on the IDPs’ crop land, and tensions simmered, driving theft and violence. The flooding in 2022 made things even worse, increasing IDP numbers: and the water supply for everyone was insufficient and dirty.</p>



<p>With funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund, Caritas Nigeria reconstructed the borehole with a solar-powered mechanism. And they trained mechanics in the town to maintain and repair it.</p>



<p><strong><em>Everyone benefits.</em></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>The repaired well brought other developments. Herder leaders visited the IDP community to thank them for their help in the rehabilitation.</p>



<p>One evening the herders visited the IDP camp secretary, Umaru Bappa, and requested an immediate meeting. Mr. Bappa was worried: was this news of another clash, a case of animal poisoning, or violence between their communities?</p>



<p>Mr. Bappa summoned the courage to come out of his house, yelling, “What do you want?”</p>



<p>“We come in peace,” yelled back the herder leaders. “We came to thank you for bringing us water again, even after we sold ten cows and still couldn’t fix it. We know you are the person that brought those good men* from the city in white pick-up trucks!” (*referring to Caritas Nigeria staff.)</p>



<p>‘’The men have fixed our water and our cattle are even better than before. That’s why we are here,’’ explained the herder leaders, promising Mr. Bappa that in future they would not allow their cattle to graze on the IDP farms.</p>



<p>Now relaxed, Mr. Bappa smiled and said, “You are welcome, my people. We are all one people. I appreciate you too.’’</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, Port Sudan. </strong>On the outskirts of Port Sudan, an unassuming old building known as Alshahinat gathering centre belies its capacity to house over 1,000 people. Each of these people sought refuge here, escaping the conflict that erupted in Khartoum in mid-April.</p>



<p>Maij Ankoni and her six children made their way to Alshahinat in June, fleeing from the Mayo neighborhood in southern Khartoum. Recently, she received a package of non-food household supplies, provided by the international NGO (INGO) <a href=""https://www.welthungerhilfe.org/"">Welthungerhilfe (WHH)</a>. This bundle included a cooking pot, a knife, various pots and pans, plates, cups - the basics for a small family.</p>



<p>The building, once a dormitory, now accommodates these displaced families, with each family allocated a room. ""Each family here comprises between 8 to 12 members, making us a community of over 1,000 people. Surprisingly, more than half of us are South Sudanese refugees who had been living in Khartoum,"" explained Bee, a 20-year-old South Sudanese refugee who now calls Port Sudan home.</p>



<p>In addition to South Sudanese refugees, there are also displaced individuals from Chad, Niger, Eritrea, and Syria, who found themselves uprooted from their lives in Khartoum due to the ongoing conflict. Mohammed, a Chadian refugee in his early twenties, shares, ""We are approximately four or five refugee families from Chad. I was born in Khartoum and spent most of my life there. When the conflict erupted, we had no choice but to seek refuge here.""</p>



<p>Many residents are displaced Sudanese. A mother, who recently arrived with her seven-months-old son Mohamed, shared their journey. ""We fled from Khartoum and briefly settled in Wad Madani before coming here. My son appears to have some leg muscle issues, but we're unsure about the right specialist to see, and we lack the funds for medical care.""</p>



<p>Currently, WHH is transporting 20,000 liters of water daily to the site, a crucial lifeline for those displaced. Funding from <a href=""https://www.unocha.org/sudan/about-sudan-humanitarian-fund"">the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF)</a> has made this possible. ""This allocation equates to approximately 20 liters of water per person per day, well within the SPHERE standards,"" Mahmud Elhaj, Head of the WHH office in Port Sudan, emphasized.</p>



<p>In a bid to improve living conditions, WHH is in the process of installing pumps and a water reservoir to ensure a stable supply of 20 tons of clean water for both refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) at the site. ""In just a few days, the entire water system will be operational, offering a sustainable solution for clean water access,"" Elhaj said.</p>



<p>The conflict that erupted in April has led to the displacement of approximately 4.2 million people within Sudan, according to the <a href=""https://dtm.iom.int/reports/dtm-sudan-weekly-displacement-snapshot-4"">International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) update</a>. Out of these, approximately 107,600 individuals have sought shelter and assistance in Red Sea State and its capital, Port Sudan. <a href=""https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZjMxNjRkY2EtOTJhMC00NzcxLWEwOTMtYTFjZDliOGEwZDQ2IiwidCI6ImU1YzM3OTgxLTY2NjQtNDEzNC04YTBjLTY1NDNkMmFmODBiZSIsImMiOjh9"">UNHCR reports</a> that roughly 1.07 million people have fled to neighboring countries. Notably, about 188,000 refugees who were already residing in Sudan before the current crisis have either been displaced or have voluntarily relocated within Sudan, including 16,000 refugees who now call Port Sudan their new home.</p>

<p><strong>Somalia, Bay region. </strong>When Amino Aadan first came to Hirdoogle displacement site, she wasn’t sure how she’d make a living to provide for her children.</p>



<p>The longest and most severe drought seen in Somalia in at least 40 years affected millions and drove further displacement. The Somalia Humanitarian Fund allocated US$71 million in 2022 to scale up life-saving response and prevent famine.</p>



<p>Amino initially washed clothes and cleaned her neighbours’ homes, but she wasn’t earning enough to feed her children well.</p>



<p>With funding from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, Somali partner organization <strong>Northern Frontier Youth League (NoFYL)</strong><strong> </strong>supported a cash-for-work scheme at the displacement site, including garbage collection, weed-removal, and other clean-up efforts.</p>



<p>Three months of work meant three months of pay, and a chance for Amino and other vulnerable families to start small businesses of their own, pay off debts, or buy the basics their families needed.</p>



<p>Amino used the money she earned to start selling vegetables and provide a more reliable income for her family. “I depend on this shop to feed my children and I hope to expand it soon and bring other items for my customers,” she said.</p>



<p>Dadir Adan, a young man who fled conflict in Shebelle ten months ago, was team leader for the cash-for-work programme. “Some of the beneficiaries used the money to purchase food, while others bought clothes for their children, especially last month to celebrate Eid-Al-Fitr. The money assisted a lot of us who didn’t know what to do to cover family expenses during Eid.”</p>



<p>Awliyo, another programme participant, used her first month’s payment to start a small business selling firewood. With only three months of work under the scheme, she had to plan next steps, and from firewood sales, she expanded to other goods, allowing her to make a living in the camp. “It’s small but it’s bringing in money I didn’t have before,” explained Awliyo. She said she appreciated the cash-for-work programme, but hopes next time it will run for longer.</p>



<p>Fadumo also saved up to start a business. This young woman sells clothes and shoes, a business jump-started with earnings from the cash-to-work scheme. “I can say that I benefited twice: the camp is clean <em>and</em> I started my own business. I don’t depend on anyone now but myself, and I hope to expand my business and start selling wholesale clothes to the shops around here.”</p>



<p>Hassan, an elderly man, used his earnings to clear his debts. “Without any work, it was difficult to pay the debt and this ruined relationships with other people. Through the program I was able to pay off my debts and I used the leftover cash to buy food for my family. It didn’t cover all of my needs but it definitely helped.”</p>

<p><strong>Nigeria, Borno state. </strong>When fire broke out in a displacement camp in Monguno area, Aishatu lost her home and her household essentials, like mosquito nets, blankets and cooking supplies. “I lost sleep, thinking about how to survive with my children. Life has not been easy with the mosquitoes and the cold. I had to borrow a can to fetch water and had only one dish to cook and serve my family.” <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Thirteen years on, the conflict in Nigeria’s north-east states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe continues unabated. The impact of the conflict in the BAY states, home to some 16 million people, has created a protracted humanitarian and protection crisis affecting millions of people – including two million people displaced by the years of fighting.</p>



<p>Borno state hosts 3.9 million people in humanitarian need, including Aishatu.</p>



<p>Babaganu Madu, a father who was displaced with his wives and children, expressed similar concerns. “I have lost the dignity of my family because I can’t provide for their needs.”</p>



<p>Nigerian organization ‘Concern for Women and Children Development Foundation’ &nbsp;assisted some 800 families with basic household and essential shelter supplies with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund. .</p>



<p>The supplies - including hygiene kits, blankets, mattresses, water storage containers, mosquito nets, lamps, bathing and washing detergents, and cooking utensils were available for displaced people and for vulnerable members of the host community. An elderly man from the town said, “I came here with nothing. I have no money, so I can't afford to buy even a small bowl in the market.”</p>



<p>For Aishatu, the supplies meant she could fetch water without borrowing a jerrycan from neighbours, cook more dishes for her family, , and use blankets instead of old clothing to keep the children warm at night.</p>



<p>Beyond the immediate impact, this support helped restore a sense of normalcy and dignity to the lives of these families.</p>

<p>Overall, Borno state hosts about 3.9 million people in humanitarian need, including Kaka Hajja.</p>



<p>In Idrisari, she decided to sell ground nut oil. She was doing this by hand, which takes a long time, and earning about 1200-1500 naira per week.This is about 5-7 dollars per month. She also lacked essential supplies like good frying pans and sieves that would make her work easier.</p>



<p>Nigerian organization CRUDAN, with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund, provided cash and training to Kaka Hajja and other women.

<p><strong>Ethiopia, Somali region.&nbsp;</strong>In the remote town of Filtu in the Somali Region, a group of dedicated healthcare professionals embarked on a mission to provide essential medical services to people living in hard-to-reach areas, like Jibal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malaria is endemic to the country, with almost 1.4 million malaria cases reported in the first half of 2023. In the rainy season – which began in September 2023 – cases are increasing.</p>



<p>There is currently a critical gap in malaria response. When combined with poor nutrition and other exacerbating factors, there is a potential for a high mortality rate.</p>



<p>In this isolated part of Somali region, where access to healthcare is very limited, many pastoralists face the life-threatening burden of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.</p>



<p>Thanks to the “Integrated Multi-Sectoral Emergency Responses to Drought Affected Population in Somali Region” project, funded by the&nbsp;<strong>Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund</strong>, local organization Doctors with Africa CUAMM set up a mobile health and nutrition team base in Filtu to respond.</p>



<p>Adan Mohamed Diriye, a pastoralist who met the team, had been battling the debilitating effects of malaria. &nbsp;The MHNT was able to administer antimalarial medications to treat Adan’s infection and his recovery became a beacon of hope for the community.</p>



<p>Adan's recovery had major impact for others too, leading to increased community awareness about malaria prevention and creating a demand for accessible healthcare services.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The case – and the work of the mobile health and nutrition team - became a turning point, not only for Adan and his family, but for an entire community.</p>

<p>Somalia | 2015-2016 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Somalia</strong>. In Somalia, a severe El Niño-induced drought meant hundreds of thousands of people experienced water shortages and food insecurity. In Puntland state, <strong><u>CERF funding helped UNFPA provide essential healthcare for mothers</u></strong> in villages devastated by drought.</p>



<p>In any crisis, one in five women of childbearing age are likely to be pregnant, so reproductive healthcare is an essential emergency need.</p>



<p>Rukiyo Ahmed, 26, discovered she was pregnant just as drought started came to her village, Eelbuh. &nbsp;Her family lost all their animals. The drought became so bad that Rukiyo and her family had to abandon their home and went to seek refuge with extended family members living in Dangoroyo town, 35 kilometres away.</p>



<p>“I was so worried that I would have a miscarriage due to the effects of the drought,” said Rukiyo, adding, “We had so little to eat. I became very weak and could barely walk.” She said she was desperate for a baby and had suffered two miscarriages before.</p>



<p>With CERF support, UNFPA and partners provided emergency maternal health care for Rukiyo and other affected women. “We aimed to make available emergency reproductive, maternal and new-born health services for 2,300 pregnant women&nbsp;in all the drought-affected target areas,” explained Samia Hassan, UNFPA humanitarian lead in Somalia. “We also worked on making emergency referral services available for about 400 complicated pregnancies in the target areas.”</p>



<p>Rukiyo went to one such facility in Dangoroyo for advice and specialist care given her past history of miscarriage. She delivered a healthy baby through an emergency caesarean section.</p>



<p>“I now visit the health centre for postnatal services, and I have had birth spacing support to avoid early pregnancy. I have been advised to deliver in hospital when I get pregnant again,” said Rukiyo.</p>



<p><strong><u>CERF funds helped IOM</u></strong> <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/cerf-funds-help-international-organization-migration-iom-provide-emergency-primary""><strong>deliver emergency primary health care in Puntland and Somaliland.</strong></a><strong></strong></p>



<p>In Lafta-Faraweyne village, Nimco’s two-year old son had been suffering from diarrhoea for two days, when she brought him to a mobile clinic supported by the International Organization for Migration.</p>



<p>She was very worried. “An outbreak of diarrhoea in our village affected many children and one of them died from it. Last night, I didn’t sleep at all as my child had non-stop diarrhoea and vomiting. I was worried that he will die,” she explained to the clinic staff.</p>



<p>Nimco and her son saw the doctor, who provided intravenous fluid when he noticed the child’s severe dehydration. After two hours of treatment her son started showing some energy. Nimco smiled as she explained: “My child is able to speak to me for the first time in the last eight hours, which means he is getting better.” Nimco also received emergency therapeutic food to take home with her as well as advice on follow-up care.</p>

<p>Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe | 2015-2016 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe</strong>. In 2015 and 2016, an intense drought affected southern Africa, including large swathes of Zimbabwe. Chipinge district, in the eastern highlands, was affected by the worst drought in 35 years. Thousands of cattle died for lack of pasture and water. Skeletons became a common sight. Desperate to make money for his family, Walter Mehlaba sold most of his sick animals for a low price.</p>



<p>The drought that affected him and millions across southern Africa was due to the El Niño, a naturally occurring phenomenon where the sea surface temperature in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific rises, disrupting normal patterns of precipitation and triggering extreme climate events around the globe. East and southern Africa, central America, southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands experienced extreme weather events, including below-normal rains, droughts, flooding, and severe winters.</p>



<p>People like Walter faced threats to their access to food, their health, and their livelihoods. With a global call to action to avoid an even bigger crisis, the focus was on meeting people’s immediate humanitarian needs and supporting resilience, including building capacities to weather future shocks. CERF’s allocations across the globe helped save lives and livelihoods from the worst effects.</p>



<p>In Zimbabwe, Walter Mhlaba received assistance from FAO, supported by CERF, to access subsidized animal feed and drought-tolerant grains for his remaining animals, and he was able to establish a ‘drought mitigation revolving fund’ in the most vulnerable district. The communities used this money to buy more stock feed and rehabilitate water points serving humans and livestock.</p>



<p>In Malawi and Mozambique, extreme rains and floods displaced over 300,000 people. <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/sites/default/files/resources/cerf_rr_2016_en.pdf"">Many people lost everything, including their homes.</a> With CERF support, UN agencies were able to provide emergency life-saving help including food and cash-based assistance. For many, humanitarian aid was the only source of food and nutrition during the initial days of the crisis. Esnart Thomu and her family were among those affected. “I now sleep on a full stomach and wake with the assurance that there is still food to keep me going. This food gives me hope,” she said.</p>



<p>CERF funds helped provide emergency shelters, tools, clean water, and seeds, so that families could look after themselves and their farms - and plan for the next harvest.</p>

<p>DRC | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>DRC, Ituri province.&nbsp;</strong>Georgine Loza Mudzi was reluctant to return home. She knew her house had been destroyed and all her possessions looted in recent fighting.</p>



<p>In June 2023, <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/plan-operationnel-republique-democratique-du-congo-ituri-nord-kivu-et-sud-kivu-juin-2023"">humanitarian organizations declared a ‘system-wide scale up to their response in Ituri and North</a> and South Kivu, due to increasing humanitarian need. The scale-up aims to strengthen the ongoing humanitarian response, with a focus on food scarcity, protection and the spread of disease, including those caused by poor sanitation.</p>



<p>After a year of displacement, life was still very difficult for Georgine and her family, who are among the 7.8 million people with the highest humanitarian needs in DRC. She and her husband couldn’t afford the children’s school fees in their place of displacement, and neither of them could find work. Their fields and other property had been left behind in their home location.</p>



<p>That is why they decided to return.</p>



<p>“Eleven months ago, we decided to return to our village, despite the fact that the security situation is still not entirely reassuring,”Georgine explained.</p>



<p>Their house, and all its infrastructure – including the latrine – were destroyed. ""When we came back here, we couldn't find the latrine because it had been burnt down, which meant that we had to relieve ourselves outside.” The children were often getting sick.</p>



<p>Tearfund, with support from the DRC Humanitarian Fund, visited Georgine’s town. &nbsp;After attending one of the awareness meetings, Georgine’s husband said they must rebuild and improve their latrines.</p>



<p>Tearfund provided tools and supplies to improve the water and sanitation facilities, and install hand-washing stations for every home.</p>



<p> “These will reduce disease in our village,” says Georgine.</p>

<p><strong>Somalia, Baidoa district.&nbsp;</strong>Khadija is a mother of seven, living in Arsham displacement camp. She fled Bahkool region for many reasons. First, the ongoing drought devastated her crops. And second, numerous conflicts made it dangerous to stay there.</p>



<p>The displacement camp wasn’t much better. There was only one latrine and people were forced to go outdoors to relieve themselves. Like many of the other mothers, Khadjia was worried about her children’s health. She also felt unsafe at night, as she explained.</p>



<p>“In the past, women have faced violence at night. This was made worse because it was so dark.”</p>



<p>The longest and most severe drought seen in Somalia in at least 40 years has affected millions and driven further displacement in the country. The Somalia Humanitarian Fund allocated US$46 million in 2023 to scale up life-saving response.</p>



<p>With funding from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, Acted constructed four new latrines in the camp, equipped with hand washing facilities and solar lights as well. The lights make a real difference to safety.</p>



<p>“Now that we have the solar lights installed, things have improved. We can see better and we feel safer.”</p>

<p>Haiti, Somalia and Sudan | 2023 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Haiti, Somalia and Sudan. </strong>Miido (not her real name) has survived violence, both physical and emotional. Only in her thirties, conflict and drought ravaged her village in Somalia. Like many others, Miido sought refuge in the Gargaar 2 displacement camp.</p>



<p>The longest and most severe drought seen in Somalia in at least 40 years has affected millions and driven further displacement in the country.</p>



<p>Such displacement from their homes makes girls and women more vulnerable to gender-based violence. Indeed, humanitarians have recognized <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ocha-discussion-paper-gendered-drivers-risks-and-impacts-food-insecurity-sahel-and-horn-africa"">“a protracted and growing GBV emergency” in</a> the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, driven by food insecurity, drought, and insecurity.</p>



<p>Miido didn’t expect to find a glimmer of hope there, but in fact she did, at the “One Stop” Center. The&nbsp;One-Stop Center operated by NoFYL, with the vital support of UNFPA, thanks to the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was a refuge for women like Miido.</p>



<p>Here, she encountered compassion and support. They met her not with judgement or pity but with understanding and a commitment to help her rebuild. She worked with counsellors there and, for the first time, was able to be in a safe place where she could discuss what had happened.</p>



<p>Crucially, UNFPA's financial support played a pivotal role for Miido. The cash assistance she received was a lifeline, allowing her to access essential resources and services. It provided a foundation of economic stability to help rebuild her life. Miido began working to help other women who had lived through similar experiences.</p>



<p>Access to, and quality of, GBV services is chronically poor and deeply inadequate across the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Such services are extremely limited and stretched, making it very hard to cope with a significant increase in cases of GBV, caused by worsening food insecurity and other pressures..</p>



<p><em>Safe spaces for women around the world</em></p>



<p>In crisis contexts across the world, for women living through the aftermath of the worst conflicts and natural disasters, safe spaces offer an important resource – where healthcare, mental health support, or just a listening ear can be found.</p>



<p>In Kosti, White Nile, where <a href=""https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan"">over six million people have been displaced by conflict since April 2023</a>, a safe space funded by UNCEF is providing psychosocial support and linking women to health care and further support.</p>



<p>In Haiti, the ‘Kathy Mangonès space’, supported by UNFPA and Oxfam, and funded by CERF in 2022, plays a similar role. “We support women and girls who have suffered violence in all forms,” says Louise Marie Naissant, the coordinator. “And we accompany women and girl survivors of violence to the hospital when it’s necessary,” explains Naissant. ""These safe spaces are important,” she adds.</p>

<p><strong>Colombia, </strong>Chocó and Nariño<strong>.</strong> In a crisis, women and girls often suffer disproportionately. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened structural inequalities and women’s access to healthcare and other support.</p>



<p>UN Women has focused on strengthening women’s role in recovery from Covid and other disasters and resilience in the face of crises to come.</p>



<p>With funding from CERF, UNWomen implemented the multiple country “Together Saving Lives” project in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Colombia, Ethiopia, Myanmar and oPt. The programme focused on violence prevention, women’s empowerment, livelihoods and rights in emergency contexts.</p>



<p>In Colombia, the programme brought together nearly 3,000 women from seventeen local and regional organizations for training and knowledge sharing.</p>



<p>In Chocó department, the pandemic saw a marked increase in cases of gender-based and family-based violence, and limited access to reproductive services. In Nariño, heavily affected by violence and displacement, women faced increased sexual and gender-based violence.</p>



<p>The programme brought together civil society leaders such as Yaila Mena. “We built alliances to help protect ourselves and lead. Walking together - not one behind another but side by side – we can help our region move forward.”</p>



<p>Participants noted the importance of bringing Afro and indigenous women to the table, as Luz Iliana Carpio, explained. “These projects help more women raise their voice, and it’s critical that the work keeps spreading and reaching other women and territories.”</p>



<p>The project continues and aims to reach about 12,000 women and children to address the worst impacts of violence.</p>

<p>Ethiopia | 2022- 2023 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Ethiopia. </strong>Mengistie Tegenie’s four sisters were married before the age of 18. Bright and academically gifted, their schooling — like that of many young women in Ethiopia — stopped after their arranged marriages.</p>



<p>During his first year at university, Tegenie says he felt guilty that he was able to continue his studies while his sisters were not. For many young women, he adds, child marriage doesn’t just block them from career opportunities; it comes with the added risk of violence.</p>



<p>“I realised that the men must also speak up; that I’d have to be the one to make the change,” he explains. Today, Tegenie, a GBV specialist for Norwegian Church Aid, has dedicated his professional life to ending child marriage and violence against women.</p>



<p>These threats, Tegenie says, have only been growing more severe:&nbsp;<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/gbv-aor-ethiopia-situation-gbv-ethiopia-september-2022-0"">GBV has spiked</a>&nbsp;amid a brutal two-year conflict, drought, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have trapped women and girls in vulnerable conditions. Child marriages have also&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/child-marriage-rise-horn-africa-drought-crisis-intensifies"">more than doubled</a>&nbsp;in the country's four hardest-hit regions.</p>



<p>In response, Tegenie and Norwegian Church Aid have partnered with UN Women and UNFPA to address attitudes and beliefs that perpetuate GBV and gender inequalities in several local Ethiopian communities. The initiative, which started in 2022, is supported through a Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF) global grant allocation on GBV prevention and response, which has been implemented in six countries, including Ethiopia.</p>



<p><em>Changing social norms begins at the grassroots</em></p>



<p>To change social norms, Tegenie says, awareness-raising must begin at the grassroots level. With support from UN Women, Norwegian Church Aid held community conversations led by trained facilitators to discuss the ramifications of child marriage and violence against women. At the end of the dialogue, community leaders were asked to make public declarations denouncing these practices and add sanctions and other consequences into local bylaws.</p>



<p>“We want to engage men and boys and change their attitudes towards these practices. We want them to be aware of how it affects the lives of women and girls, and engage in community efforts to end violence against women and girls,” says Tegenie.</p>



<p>Ultimately, he acknowledges, social norm change takes a long time and requires the buy-in of community leaders. In many regions of Ethiopia, that includes faith leaders, some of whom have been promoting harmful practices against women and girls.</p>



<p>Tegenie and Norwegian Church Aid provided training for 48 faith leaders across Orthodox, Protestant, and Islamic traditions and encouraged the country’s top religious councils to issue their own declarations stating that GBV and child marriage have no basis in their religions. “These religious institutions influence the parish priests, the pastors, in the grassroots communities. That’s what changes norms,” he says.</p>

<p>Malawi has been experiencing increased frequency, intensity, and magnitude of extreme weather events. &nbsp;Tropical Cyclone Freddy hit Malawi just as the country was facing one of the worst cholera outbreaks in recent history, as well as high food insecurity at the peak of the lean season. The Cyclone <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/malawi/unicef-malawi-humanitarian-situation-report-no-8-mid-year-2023"">displaced over 600,000 people</a>. Displacement from their normal homes and communities makes girls and women more vulnerable to abuse.</p>



<p>Mary had recently attended a training on how to handle gender-based violence cases when the girl came to her for help. As the women were discussing what actions to take next, the perpetrator arrived at the camp, threatening to punish the girl.</p>



<p>Instead, the chief stepped in. He met with the man and confronted him with the allegations, subsequently calling the police. Meanwhile, the girl was able to access health services and mental health support.</p>



<p>With funding from the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and other donors, UNICEF is supporting the Malawi Police Service to protect children and women in disaster zones, including evacuation camps.</p>



<p>According to Chikwawa Police Victim Support Units coordinator Mvunthe, this programme has improved safety, security, and the management of GBV cases detected in camps.</p>



<p>“The support is timely because GBV cases are rampant in our disaster-prone district, where some men take advantage of displacement, hunger and poverty to sexually assault women. We’ve recorded 11 cases from January to March this year, up from just nine during the same quarter last year.”</p>

<p>DRC | 2022 and 2023 | CERF and CBPF</p>



<p><strong>DRC, North Kivu and Ituri provinces.</strong> The successive humanitarian crises have affected the lives of civilians in eastern DRC and driven mass displacement and violence. Many thousands of women and girls have suffered from gender-based violence.</p>



<p>Armed men attacked Samantha when she was on her way to a neighbouring village to do marketing.</p>



<p>Local NGO ‘Hope in Action’ is implementing a GBV response programme alongside UNFPA, with funding from the DRC Humanitarian Fund. Because of this programme, Samantha was able access health and psychological support to help her deal with the aftermath of the attack. She later married her fiancée and started a family with him.</p>



<p>The programme also supports maternal health care provision, which Samantha used when she and her husband grew their family and she became pregnant with twins.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that the programme supports the partners of violence survivors. Samantha’s husband, Sam, has stayed by her side. “I quickly understood that it was not her fault, and I continue to support her &nbsp;by going with her to the health center and help her overcome the ordeal.”</p>



<p>""I was at the health center when my wife gave birth. I must admit I never imagined having two babies at the same time. The midwife sprinkled flour on my head and called me ‘Father’. I was amazed and very happy. Since then, I have truly felt like a 'Father’,"" said Samantha’s husband.</p>



<p><em>Making sure the response is holistic</em></p>



<p>CERF funding supported a similar programme with UNFPA across several regions of eastern DRC. Working with local partners including SOFEPADI, UNFPA aimed to holistically strengthen the response in the heavily affected areas on North Kivu and Ituri.</p>



<p>Stephanie was raped as she fled violence in her home village. Only sixteen years old, she then learned she was pregnant because of the rape.</p>



<p>""We had fled the attackers who entered the village, beating, looting everything in their path, and setting houses on fire. We walked for five days, eating nothing until we reached the displacement site next to the General Reference Hospital in Bunia. If we had been in our village, I would not have &nbsp;suffered this, and I would not have become a mother so early.""</p>



<p>Stephanie had chosen not to report the rape until the day a community relay officer (who visits communities with sensitization information) came to talk about GBV at the displacement site. Stephanie told the community officer what had happened, who recommended her to SOFEPADI for support.</p>



<p>Stephanie accessed psychological support and healthcare at the SOFEPADI-run Safe Space. Established at the Bigo Health Center with the support of UNFPA and CERF funding, this Safe Space is an ideal framework for supporting vulnerable women and GBV survivors.</p>



<p>The Salama Safe Space provides psychological support, information on the availability of medical and legal services, referral to health services in the Bunia health zone, and also empowers women and girls by helping them learn a trade (basket-weaving, mat-making, and tailoring).</p>



<p>Stephanie also learned a trade there. “I made the dress that my daughter is wearing,” she explains as her baby plays nearby, adding that she also learned to make baskets and mats.</p>



<p>Henriette Dhinbe Liripa, Psychosocial Assistant and facilitator of this safe space, explained,""We don't just support GBV survivors, but all women and girls in the community who might need our services. We organize active listening sessions, therapeutic activities, vocational training and recreational activities.”</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine | 2023 | CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ukraine, </strong><strong>Dnipropetrovska oblast</strong><strong>. </strong>A friendly black dog dashes around Liubov Yakovleva’s backyard farm , greeting any and all visitors with a wag of not just his tail but his entire body.</p>



<p>This four-legged friend, Karandash, helps keep Liubov from feeling lonely now that her husband has passed away and her children and grandchildren can only visit on holidays or vacations.</p>



<p>Liubov was born in a concentration camp in Germany during the Second World War. “I was born during the war, far from my native country. And now, at the end of my life, I face war again, in my homeland.”</p>



<p>Liubov never thought she would have to experience war again, but now her primary concern is for her children and grandchildren.</p>



<p>“My heart cries for all the children who, like me when I was a child, suffer from this war.”</p>



<p><em>School supplies for the grandchildren</em></p>



<p>In her small backyard, Liubov grows vegetables to support herself and her family. She doesn’t have much money for extras.</p>



<p>When she received cash assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported by CERF and other donors, she used it to buy food and household supplies and to support her &nbsp;grandchildren, even though they live far away.</p>



<p>“I spent this money on my grandchildren. We bought school supplies, some food, and firewood for the winter heating season,"" added Liubov.</p>



<p>“I didn't even think I would get any money. I did not believe it at first,” said Liubov, with tears in her eyes. “I am grateful to FAO for this help and to everyone who helped me to apply for and receive the assistance.”</p>



<p><em>Setting up a new household</em></p>



<p>Oleksandr Myroshnychenko fled his home in Popasna, Luhanska oblast. He and his family also received multipurpose cash assistance.</p>



<p>“When we left Popasna, we took only the most essential things. I am retired. My wife worked at the glass factory in Popasna, but then she was laid off, so my pension was the only source of income,” said Oleksandr.</p>



<p>They used the money to get household supplies for their new home. “The cash assistance provided by FAO was absolutely crucial for us. We were able to buy a washing machine and a refrigerator, not new but in good condition. We are very grateful for the help.”</p>



<p><em>A helping hand for host communities</em></p>



<p>Halyna Voitiuk lives in Komisarivka village in Dnipropetrovska oblast. She takes care of two grandchildren who live with her. She is retired but grows vegetables and fruit to can ahead for the winter period.</p>



<p>Following the outbreak of war in February 2022, Halyna opened her doors to families in need. Right now, a couple with two young children who fled hostilities were staying with her.</p>



<p>“They are unlikely to be able to go home in the near future. The man has found a job in a neighbouring village, and the woman takes care of the kids,” said Halyna.</p>



<p>Halyna and the displaced family received assistance. With the multipurpose cash assistance from FAO, Halyna notes, “I bought my grandson a bicycle so that he can get to school and my granddaughter a tablet for her college studies. Before I could not buy them many things, so this assistance was really crucial.”</p>



<p>The cash assistance programme, supported by CERF and other donors, reached about 7,000 people in rural areas between summer 2022 and February 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Philippines | 2023 | CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Philippines, Southern Leyte.</strong> When Typhoon Odette (international name: Rai) struck the Philippines&nbsp;in December 2021, it left a trail of destruction, leaving thousands of families homeless and many government and health facilities damaged or destroyed by strong winds and landslides.</p>



<p>The rural health unit serving Himbangan village in St. Bernard, Southern Leyte town was among those heavily damaged.</p>



<p>Women’s Health on Wheels (WHoW) was ready. Funded by CERF and other donors, WHoW is a mobile birthing facility that provides on site maternal and reproductive health care for women during emergencies.</p>



<p>Midwife Edna Tumandao traveled from the neighboring province of Eastern Samar to help. Her province was not as badly hit by Typhoon Odette so their governor decided to send them on a “solidarity mission” to Southern Leyte.</p>



<p>“During Super-typhoon Yolanda (international name: Haiyan), other provinces helped us. In return, our provincial health officer and governor wanted to give back, which was why they sent us,” she explains.</p>



<p>The WhoW facility reached hundreds of women in need. Edna explained, “It’s a very nice facility. It comes complete with air-conditioner, delivery table, waiting room, a bed and other facilities. It’s like a mini-hospital.”</p>



<p>Mariel was the first woman to give birth in the facility after Typhoon Odette. After the typhoon ruined her local clinic, she was scared for her baby’s safety. It was a relief to hear about the WHoW truck and its services.</p>



<p>By evening, her healthy baby daughter was delivered.</p>

<p><strong>Peru: Tumbes Piura and Lambayeque</strong>. Maria Mercedes leads a women’s shelter in La Molina II settlement. She has helped several women get health care and file police reports after incidents of gender-based violence.</p>



<p>The intense rains and floods caused by Cyclone Yaku and the coastal El Niño phenomenon had affected the lives of over half a million people and displaced nearly 96,000 as of May 2023. This is how the climate crisis is affecting people. And, as in displacement crises the world over, women and girls are at increased risk of violence.</p>



<p>The Emergency Relief Coordinator allocated $6.9 million from CERF’s Rapid Response window for humanitarian response activities. This funding enabled UN agencies and partners to provide life-saving assistance for 223,000 people, including in protection and GBV services.</p>



<p>CERF funding has helped UNFPA and local partners guarantee access for more affected women to comprehensive, timely services including sexual and reproductive health care. The money has funded mobile clinics that offer health care and protection services for women and girls affected by floods in the north.</p>



<p>Alongside this, UNFPA conducted training for local and regional government officials, as well as public health workers, on preventing and responding to GBV in emergencies.</p>



<p>As Ms. Mercedes explains, social change is not easy. ""As a leader, I have gone to the police station, filed complaints, and witnessed women changing their minds about reporting. This happens because no one is providing them with support and security so that they don’t feel alone,"" she says.</p>



<p>The mobile clinics offer some help. ""I am pleased to see that organizations like the United Nations Population Fund are fully committed to the realities we face as women every day. Through workshops and psychological and legal assistance, they provide invaluable support on our journey,"" she adds.</p>

<p><strong>Ethiopia, Mozambique | 2023 | CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ethiopia: Hargele and Mozambique: Cabo Delgado.</strong> After losing many of their cattle to the drought, Lina’s family left the village of Hulul seeking help and settled in a makeshift shelter in Bul’ad camp, in Ethiopia’s Hargele region. It is almost a year since they arrived and the family is struggling to survive.</p>



<p>Five consecutive seasons of failed rainfall have pushed children and families in the Horn of Africa, including the Somali region of Ethiopia, into crisis. Communities have resorted to extreme measures to survive, with thousands of families leaving their homes out of desperation in search of water, food, pasture, and treatment for sick children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each day, Lina’s father tries to find work in town as a day laborer. Her mother, Halima, takes care of Lina and another son, Mohammed, both of whom have developmental disabilities.</p>



<p>“I am not like the other parents here. I have two children with disabilities. Mohammed is six and still unable to speak. And if I left Lina by herself, she could wander around and get hurt. Besides, she has epilepsy,” Halima says.</p>



<p>“When kids bully her, she gets upset. That’s why I prefer to keep her at home. If she is sad, she loses her appetite and is likely to have an epileptic episode. Sometimes, she asks questions that I cannot answer. That makes me feel bad,” she explains.</p>



<p>Lina is among the many children with disabilities in Bul’ad camp. The needs of children affected&nbsp;by polio, those with hearing and visual impairments and other forms of disabilities, are often not addressed in an emergency.</p>



<p>To support Lina’s family and others, UNICEF includes an additional “disability top-up” in cash transfers, funded by CERF and other donors. This helps families address some of the additional needs that caring for children with disabilities entails.</p>



<p>“What we are providing here is cash support to help families improve their nutritional status. It is important that they have options to buy essentials depending on their needs.&nbsp; We also share information with mothers about better child feeding practices,” says Utpal Moitra, Chief of the UNICEF Somali Region Field Office.</p>



<p>So far, more than 1,700 families have received a cash grant, and priority is given to parents who have children with disabilities, like Halima. Halima used the extra cash to buy epilepsy medication for Lina.</p>



<p><strong><em>Access to education with children with disability</em></strong></p>



<p>The confluence of multiple crises is worsening an already severe humanitarian situation in Mozambique, where two million people needed humanitarian assistance and protection across the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado, Niassa and Nampula.</p>



<p>In February, more than 239,000 people were further affected by the heavy rains and Tropical Storm Freddy.</p>



<p>Already overwhelmed schools and healthcare facilities were struggling to provide services to everyone in need, particularly for children with disabilities, who are often overlooked in a displacement crisis.</p>



<p>CERF funding helped UNICEF to establish two Support Units for Children with Special Educational Needs in Pemba and Montepuez districts.</p>



<p>These allowed over 3,000 children to access inclusive education, and those who needed them were able to have customized wheelchairs and other assistive devices, giving them a start toward re-establishing normalcy.</p>

<p><strong>Vanuatu, Ethiopia, Yemen and others| 2023 | CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ethiopia, Vanuatu, Yemen and others.</strong> As food prices <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/brief/food-security-update"">continue to rise worldwide</a>, the Central Emergency Response Fund is at the forefront of helping emergency-affected people get food assistance and cash; to improve their kitchen garden food production and agricultural livelihoods after disasters; and prevent the worst effects of malnutrition.</p>



<p><em>Mobile health and nutrition teams in Ethiopia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Temira, mother to one-year-old Zahara, has brought her daughter to a mobile outreach health site near her home in Chifra, Afar, in north-eastern Ethiopia, for vaccination and a check-up.</p>



<p>Ethiopia has now suffered five seasons of failed rains and over 24 million people face food insecurity. Most of the drought-affected people are nomadic pastoralists who need assistance just to survive. This number has nearly tripled since the first half of 2022.</p>



<p>Deep in the remote drought-gripped areas of Ethiopia, mobile teams, with World Health Organization (WHO) support and funding from CERF and other donors, are working to deliver critical health assistance and malnutrition treatment. This saves lives, especially among children for whom the combination of malnutrition and disease can be fatal.</p>



<p>""This clinic is near my home, so I can easily bring Zahara,"" she says. ""When I am not feeling well, I also receive health services here.""</p>



<p>Nurse Ahmed Amin attends to Zahara and measures her arm using a mid-upper arm circumference measuring tape, a critical tool used to screen children for acute malnutrition. “I observe children here up to the age of five years and I conduct nutrition screenings,” explains Ahmed.</p>



<p>“I am very happy to be part of this mobile health team because this location is quite remote. Were it not for this team, people would not have easy access to health care,” says Ahmed.</p>



<p><em>Cyclone-affected people restore their home gardens in Vanuatu</em></p>



<p>Jane Sola, a farmer in Teuma, Port Vila, has been affected by two cyclones this year. In an unprecedented occurrence this year, Vanuatu experienced the wrath of Tropical Cyclone Judy, immediately followed by Tropical Cyclone Kevin just days later. This rapid succession of cyclones magnified the devastation inflicted upon the island nation, exacerbating the already significant damage caused by the initial storm.</p>



<p>With CERF and other funding, FAO worked to distribute critical seeds to affected areas. Ms. Sola and others were able to re-sow and grow food in their home gardens. ""The backyard gardens have been improved. Tools and seeds provided by FAO have been instrumental in helping us overcome the effects of the two cyclones,” she says.</p>



<p><em>Reproductive health care for women facing food insecurity</em></p>



<p>Women and girls in Yemen continue to bear the brunt of the conflict-induced crisis. Yemen has one of the highest maternal death rates in the region, with less than half of births assisted by skilled medical personnel and only one in five of the health facilities that remain, providing maternal and child health services.</p>



<p>Over 1.5 million pregnant and breastfeeding women were projected to experience acute malnutrition in the course of 2023. They risk giving birth to babies with severe stunted growth, and nursing malnourished infants because they themselves aren’t getting enough to eat.</p>



<p>CERF funding helped UNFPA reach 50,000 women and girls in the worst affected Al Hudaydah, Hajjah, and Taizz governorates. Improved reproductive health care can help prevent malnourished babies, and improve women’s access to protection services as well.</p>



<p><em>Funding helps people around the world</em></p>



<p>In Syria, UNDP used CERF to support resilient livelihoods for women like Naima, who recently returned to her home village after conflict-related displacement. She received better seeds, an improved irrigation system and the training to use it.</p>



<p>Not only did Naima grow courgettes to feed her family but made a good profit selling the surplus. “We were told there would be some support to cultivate the land. Our previous system was not very good, but now we can do it right,” she explains.</p>



<p>Similarly, CERF funding helped people affected by <a href=""https://twitter.com/FAOCameroun/status/1707040716726108183?s=20"">severe food insecurity in Cameroon</a> with seeds, tools, and livestock.; while CERF helped WFP <a href=""https://twitter.com/WFP_Haiti/status/1701988080394051917?s=20"">deliver daily hot meals</a> for people displaced by violence in Haiti’s Carrefour Feuilles and Savane Pistache districts.</p>

<p><strong>Madagascar, Antananarivo.</strong> “A year ago, getting health care would have been a luxury,” explains Toky Rabemaharo, a leader from Marokarima commune.</p>



<p>“After the two cyclones hit, we couldn’t get to the health center.” Toky explains that his pregnant wife died, as did several other people he knew, from preventable complications.</p>



<p>“Today we have this ‘luxury’ again.”</p>



<p>With funding from CERF and other donors, WHO have deployed mobile clinics to give a million people access to health care in areas heavily affected by the cyclones, including in Toky’s community.</p>



<p>""The interventions of the mobile clinics have been of considerable value because they have helped restore healthcare services, especially vaccination services in basic health centers, and also covered areas that are usually inaccessible to healthcare, like remote villages and localities,” says Dr. Yasmine Laetitia Lydie, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Health. ""The mobile clinics have strengthened epidemiological surveillance, detection, and reporting of vaccine-preventable diseases.""</p>



<p><em>Better prepared for the next emergency</em></p>



<p>In preparation for Cyclone Freddy in February 2023, some 17 doctors and laboratory technicians from the Fitovinany, Vatovavy, and Atsim Atsinanana regions, where water-related diseases had been reported after the cyclones, were trained to manage healthcare in a crisis, including blood transfusion services.</p>



<p>People living in high-risk areas were invited to join the eight accommodation sites set up for their safety before the cyclone hit.</p>



<p>Learning from the cyclone season of 2022, when medicine stocks were destroyed, WHO built a storage warehouse for essential supplies and medical equipment in Manakara to serve the three regions of the greater Southeast. The organization also provided kits, including medicines for malaria and diarrheal diseases, among others.</p>



<p>This year, before Cyclone Freddy arrived, healthcare teams were permanently present at each site to address any potential diseases and epidemics.</p>



<p>Despite the torrential rains and numerous floods caused by Cyclone Freddy, the country did not record any cases of diseases like cholera.</p>

<p><strong>Somalia, Jubaland.</strong> &nbsp;Samda recently started a grocery business at the IDP camp in Kismayo where she and her children live. They fled the devastating drought in their village, and it has been difficult to make a living.</p>



<p>The longest and most severe drought seen in Somalia in at least 40 years has affected millions and driven displacement across the country.</p>



<p>Working with the Somali organization SEDHURO, UNFPA Somalia provided displaced women with cash assistance, supported by CERF. It’s with this cash – worth about USD50 – that Samda purchased the goods to start her business.</p>



<p>Now life is a bit easier – she can afford school fees and the basics for her children. She also enjoyed providing the essentials to her community through the shop.</p>



<p><br>In an emergency, cash can be a great help, because it allows people affected by a crisis to make their own decisions and take action to buy what they need, or make investments, like Samda’s, that can pay off in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Syria | 2023 | CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Syria, rural Aleppo.</strong> Jouriyah Al Khalaf,45 years old, is from a small village in rural Aleppo. Jouriyah lost her husband during the COVID-19 pandemic, and she was left the sole breadwinner for her nine children.</p>



<p>“We were getting by on my husband's salary before he passed away, in addition to whatever income I made from farming neighbouring land and our own plot, to cover family expenses. The fighting in the area affected us, and it became a struggle to survive. We had to leave our home for a few months before returning to the area in 2016. Deciding to come back was a tough call for us, and it ended up costing us a lot,” explains Jouriyah.</p>



<p>She and her family had to borrow money from relatives to transport their belongings back to the village, and when they finally did make it back, they found all their machinery and tools either damaged or stolen.</p>



<p>“Being landowners, we knew we could not just sit down and do nothing. We had to keep investing in our land. For a while, we relied on rain-fed farming because it was cheaper than pumping water, but this was not very sustainable, especially when living in a country that is hit by droughts for long stretches of time”.</p>



<p>Dependence on rainwater and rain-fed farming poses a high risk for families living in rural Aleppo and makes them vulnerable to drought. The cost of agricultural inputs is high, and well water in the area is often unsuitable for irrigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Syria worked with government partners to improve farmers’ livelihoods.</p>



<p>The Wheat Support and Water Scarcity Challenge project extended its support to 50 returnee farmers (16 women, eight of whom were widows) residing in various villages of Tal ad-Daman district, providing drip irrigation networks along with water pumps. Not only did the beneficiaries receive help installing the irrigation systems, but they were trained on irrigation networks and composting to maximize the benefit and become self-sufficient.</p>



<p>Jouriyah explained, “With support from the project team, we procured a 100-meter hose, three and a half rolls of the drip irrigation network, with all the needed accessories to set it all up, and a water pump.”.</p>



<p><em>The work was worth it</em></p>



<p>Thanks to a cash grant, Jouriyah was able to rent a tractor to cultivate her land for farming. “It was a lot of work, but it was worth it,” she said. “I still remember the first time we connected the pump to the electrical network. I was so excited. I could not sleep that night. I was just waiting for the electricity to start pumping water from the well onto my land. Having the pump connected to the village’s electricity network meant we did not have to extract water nearly as much as we used to. We can rely on the water from wells for irrigation and daily use, which saves us a lot of money. Instead of extracting water three times a week and paying SYP100,000 each time, we only need to do it occasionally, for drinking water.”</p>



<p>The team also shared improved seeds.</p>



<p> “It has been two months now since I planted the seedlings. I use what I harvest for cooking and sell the surplus to generate income. I was able to buy an electric scale from Aleppo to earn customers’ trust and ensure that they are getting exactly what they paid for. Our lives have completely changed. The land has become our main source of income, and I am determined to keep investing in it to make it even better. I am grateful for the opportunity that this project has given us, and I am excited to see what the future holds.”</p>

<p><strong>Democratic Republic of Congo, North Kivu. &nbsp;</strong>The emergency in DRC is one of the most complex crises globally. Clashes between armed groups have created unprecedented need and forced millions to flee their homes.</p>



<p>“We need water to prepare food, so when there’s a shortage, the family can’t eat,’’ explains Frediana, who lives at the Bushagara camp on the outskirts of Goma in the east of the country.</p>



<p>In 2023, CERF allocated over $45 million to boost the capacity of UN agencies to respond to the crisis in the east. With CERF support, UNICEF, in partnership with the Congolese organization YME Grands Lacs, constructed water stations, as well as new latrines and showers, in the camp where Frediana lives. This funding helped 108,000 displaced people access safe water and sanitation.</p>



<p>Like Frediana and many others, Christine and her six children fled their village following an increase in the fighting. They found refuge in another camp, Rusayo, just outside Goma. Christine relies on cash assistance to buy food, medicine and the essentials her children need.</p>



<p>Cash is a critical part of the emergency response. Through WFP, CERF funding supported the distribution of cash assistance worth $1.7 million in 2023.</p>



<p>""In DRC, where we face many challenges around insecurity, hampered access and poor infrastructure, this approach allows us to respond quickly and effectively. It also contributes to the resilience and recovery of local economies, supported in the long run by sustainable development,” explains Azzurra Chiarini, WFP Head of Programme in DRC.</p>



<p>“Things are good at the site – people are living together quite harmoniously. But, we are all just waiting for the war to finish so that we can go home,” says Frediana.</p>

<p><strong>Somalia, Dollow and elsewhere. </strong>“I have lived here all my life and have never seen a drought like the one we are experiencing now. Everything just dried up right in front of our eyes,” said Sahra Abdi, a 29-year-old mother who, with her children, is among the thousands of internally displaced people in Dollow.</p>



<p>In Somalia, grappling with the worst drought in four decades, humanitarian agencies received funding from CERF as part of the global allocation of $250 million in March 2023 to prevent famine and help people living through the world’s least funded crises.</p>



<p><em>Bring water to the doorstep</em></p>



<p>Sahra fled her home in the Somali Region of Ethiopia in 2021 because of the drought,. Apart from the lack of work, she says that one of the biggest challenges they face in the displacement site is the constant lack of safe water.</p>



<p>“For us to get clean and safe drinking water, it often meant long, arduous hours of walking to the nearest water source, which is an unsafe journey. This is a task I did not look forward to,” she says.</p>



<p>With support from CERF, UNICEF built twenty-five elevated water tanks that are filled at least twice a day and benefit around 5,000 people.</p>



<p>“With this newly constructed water source, the water is a few meters from my home, and this has solved many challenges for me and the community here. It was a big relief,” says Sahra.</p>



<p><em>Triumph over illness</em></p>



<p>Maryama’s life took a devastating turn when she lost her livestock to the relentless drought. She was left provide for her children alone, without support from her extended family.</p>



<p>Like many others, she was unable to find enough food for her family and the children were hungry. In July, with CERF funding, the WHO-supported Mother and Child Hospital in Heliwa district admitted Maryma's three-year-old daughter, Amina.</p>



<p>At the hospital’s stabilization centre, Amina was diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition, compounded by a range of medical complications. During her hospitalization, Amina received essential medications and therapeutic milk to stabilize her and help her grow.</p>



<p>In the weeks that followed, Amina continued her journey towards full recovery as Maryama brought her to the hospital for ongoing outpatient treatment.</p>



<p>Such was the impact of Amina’s recovery that her neighbours gave her a new name, ‘Xabaal Diid’, meaning ‘triumph over illness’.</p>



<p>Alongside Amina’s treatment, the whole family received help. Her mother said, “Without this, I would have certainly lost my daughter. As well as the treatment of my daughter, we have been provided with three meals a day, food packages, a warm blanket and cleaning supplies.”</p>



<p>“CERF assistance enables the Mother and Child Hospital to provide life-saving treatment and care for children like Amina, ensuring they have access to medical support and a chance for a better future,” said Dr Mahmud, the medical officer at the hospital.</p>



<p><strong>Cash assistance and animal feed for pastoralist families</strong></p>



<p>Shukri Hassan Ali lives with her family in Buulo Holla, Baidoa district, Somalia. “The drought had a huge effect on my family and our monthly income was even less than USD 20. But I was registered in the FAO programme and received range cubes (a kind of cattle feed) for my animals and cash to help us get our basic needs,” she explained.</p>



<p>CERF funding allowed FAO to implement a cash programme that combined cash assistance with animal feed distribution to help pastoralist families get back on their feet. Since people in this area are mainly pastoralists, the range cubes offer a way to keep animals healthy even during dry seasons, providing a critical lifeline for pastoralist families.</p>



<p>“Hopefully the remaining animals will multiply when the rains come,” she remarked. “Without FAO’s assistance, we wouldn’t be able to safeguard these remaining animals.”</p>



<p>In addition, the family will receive monthly cash payments for five months, to help weather the difficult dry season. Shukri explains that she and her husband used the money to buy medicine for their children.</p>

<p>Somalia | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Somalia, Kahda district.</strong> The worsening drought in Somalia has resulted in more vulnerability for women and girls.</p>



<p>Collecting water now involves longer walks that can be unsafe. More girls are dropping out of school, putting them at risk of early marriages. Parents who can no longer afford to pay for school fees are resorting to prioritizing boys over girls.</p>



<p>Recent reports have revealed alarming levels of sexual and gender-based violence in Somalia, primarily targeting women, girls, and marginalized groups. In 2022, the United Nations reported 340 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, primarily attributed to clan militias and Al-Shabaab: it’s likely to be an under-count of the actual levels of risk.</p>



<p>With support from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, a Somali organization, Somali Community Concern, has created a GBV mobilization team. This mobile unit visits displacement sites to raise awareness of all forms of gender-based violence, and connect women and girls to further resources.</p>



<p>The team also refers women and girls to visit the Women and Girls Safe Space, which offers psychosocial support, clinical management of rape, case management, dignity and menstrual hygiene kits, unconditional cash support to GBV survivors, and connections to the justice system.</p>



<p><em>Preventing child marriage</em></p>



<p>In one case at Kahda displacement camp, the team met with a mother who was desperate to convince her husband to stop the pending marriage of their 13-year-old daughter. The mother was deeply concerned that her husband could not be convinced – after all, they were struggling to put food on the table, he claimed.</p>



<p>The support workers in the safe space engaged the community leader, a well-respected woman, and together they met with the father. They convinced him that allowing his child to marry was a mistake. For now, the girl is safe with her younger siblings.</p>



<p>“This programme has significantly revolutionized the delivery of SGBV services in Kahda camp. It is a great start, that I hope will culminate in desirable social change in times to come,” said the leader of the Women and Girls Safe space.</p>

<p>Ukraine | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Ukraine. </strong>Throughout 2023, the war continued to wreak havoc in Ukraine. Civilians, including children, were killed and injured. Livelihoods were disrupted, while prolonged (and repeated) displacement continued to drive a massive humanitarian and protection crisis.</p>



<p>The situation cannot improve for people unless the war stops.</p>



<p>Near the front lines, entire communities are being pummeled daily, leaving millions dependent on humanitarian assistance. As 2024 begins, nearly 15 million people need humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p>Some of them are on the move, while others choose to – or must – stay put. The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund helps fund the Ukrainian organizations that do vital work to help people in need.</p>



<p><strong>Travel kits for people fleeing the war</strong></p>



<p>In June 2023, the Nova Kakhova Dam was destroyed, putting thousands of civilians in danger. Many people had to flee their homes.</p>



<p>Ukrainian organization People in Need was on the front lines, providing drinking water and other assistance. As thousands of traumatized people fled to the nearby city of Lviv, People in Need also met them with psychologists and volunteers.</p>



<p>Funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund allowed volunteers to provide each evacuee with a travel kit including food and hygiene supplies to help them on their journey.</p>



<p><strong>Repairing people’s homes so that they can return</strong></p>



<p>Nina Zahrebelna is the mayor of Virnopillia village, which is back under Ukrainian control. “Before the war, we had a population of 640 people, and today, 137 have returned,” she explains.</p>



<p>As in many villages, homes and public buildings have been damaged or destroyed – as well as heating, communication, and transport infrastructure.</p>



<p>With winter approaching, the people in Mayor Zahrebelna’s village and others in the area needed help quickly. With UHF funding, People in Need and their partner ‘Peaceful Sky’ renovated homes in Virnopillia and other nearby villages.</p>



<p>“Our priority has always been pensioners, people with disabilities, and single mothers,” says Olena Kolomiyets, who managed the construction project.</p>



<p><strong>Reaching vulnerable kids – and their teachers – with quality education and mental health support</strong></p>



<p>Children and their parents continue to face challenges in accessing education. Many students are behind because they missed schooling due to war and displacement: they also face mental health difficulties because of the war.</p>



<p>With UHF funding, the “100% Life” and “Ukrainian Smile” organizations &nbsp;recently launched a program to offer kids in rural communities digital learning opportunities . The project also aims to offer early mental health screening and referrals for support.</p>



<p>“Education and health go hand in hand,” explains Dmytro Sherembey, Head of NGO 100% Life, which focuses on the public health component. “No child in the world should have to go through what Ukrainian children are going through. This project is at the intersection of education and health: we are investing to support our children today and tomorrow.”</p>



<p>The project will support mobile classrooms with technical equipment and Ukrainian-language content, as well as building teachers’ skills in responding to mental health crises and developing best practices for referral.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine, Odesa and elsewhere.</strong> Yuliya Halayda is director of a school in Odesa. When a missile attack struck the city, the school lost electrical power.</p>



<p>The war has damaged infrastructure and energy networks throughout the country. In November 2022, the government estimated that about 40 per cent of the energy infrastructure was destroyed. People suffer regular loss of electricity and heating supply, increasing the risk of illness and disrupting work, education, and health care.</p>



<p>UNOPS has been working with the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) to help people by providing electricity generators to improve their living conditions and make sure they all have access to essential services.</p>



<p>At the beginning of 2023, UNOPS helped deliver more than 300 electricity generators to thirteen regions in Ukraine as part of an emergency response project. Funded by the UHF, the generators powered district heating and healthcare facilities, providing communities with heating and access to essential public services in case of power outages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Ms. Halayda’s school, the generator was switched on as back-up power to allow the children to continue their learning.</p>



<p>Neighbors who didn’t have electricity can use the school as a safe heating point. They can come to the school to charge their phones and get hot drinks.</p>



<p>“Emergency projects like this one are incredibly important to keep communities in Ukraine going,” says Tim Lardner, UNOPS Country Director in Ukraine.&nbsp;“The project team worked tirelessly to overcome numerous challenges, including supply shortages and logistical bottlenecks. Now that the generators are in place, they will contribute to the long-term resilience of Ukrainian district heating and medical infrastructure . Should power outages happen again, communities will be able to feel a sense of normality,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anna Yurchenko, the Deputy Minister for Communities, Territories and Infrastructure Development, noted, “We are grateful to the UHF-funded project: it is helping keep Ukrainians warm at home, in hospitals, schools, and other critical infrastructure.”</p>



<p>At Dr. Oleh Chekryzhev’s maternity hospital, in Pervomaysk, Mykolaiv Oblast, power cuts used to last half the day. This meant new mothers and their babies had no access to hot water or light. The doctors, nurses, and patients used candles and flashlights just to see in the dark. Now with the generator, back-up power is available when the cuts happen. Dr. Chekryzhev and his team hope that their patients will now be more comfortable and safe.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine, Irpin. </strong>The war in Ukraine has put vulnerable groups of people at even more risk. With family situations in flux, children and elders are at particular risk of abuse, especially if there was previous violence in the family.</p>



<p>""In times of war, when the country is going through immense suffering and pain, people sometimes downplay their own experiences, putting them aside, thinking that first we need to win the war. Undoubtedly, we should all continue to do everything possible to live in a free country, but it is important not to forget about ourselves, that enduring violence is not acceptable under any circumstances, and that we should not turn a blind eye to injustice within our own families because of the war,” says Maria Yefrosinina, UNFPA’s honorary ambassador in Ukraine.</p>



<p>According to ""La Strada-Ukraine,"" over the past three years, in 2022, the National Hotline for the Prevention and Counteraction of Gender-Based Violence received the highest number of calls: 38,472. By comparison, in 2019, there were nearly 10,000 fewer calls.</p>



<p>Social services and police, alongside civil society, are also responding to sexual violence related to the war.</p>



<p>With funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and other donors, UNFPA produced “Behind the Silence”, a documentary to shed light on the consequences of war on domestic violence, and highlight the work being done to support survivors.</p>



<p><strong>Building trust to address GBV in Irpin</strong></p>



<p>The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund also supports the response to GBV.</p>



<p>Olena and Natalia from Irpin visit schools and community centers as part of a mobile team to create awareness around gender-based violence and let people know about resources for support. The mobile teams are supported by the UN Population Fund with funding from the UHF and other donors.</p>



<p>Olena and Natalia told us their community, mostly women, motivates them to keep doing this hard difficult work. “You can be completely exhausted after a long day at work. Then, late at night, you receive a call from someone asking for help,” explains Olena.</p>



<p>“And some internal force just kicks in, helping you to find strength and energy to help this person in their hour of need. Understanding that your work helps the person persevere and face the fears plaguing them brings a new dimension to our job.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The joy that you experience when you help a person on the brink of despair also helps you,” echoes her colleague, Natalia.<br><br>Olena and Natalia explained that it took them more than a year to build trust and a reputation in the community. But now the community, especially women, has confidence in them, and will reach out for help.</p>

<p>Ukraine | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Ukraine, Poltava. </strong>Maia Kondratenko, 73, fled Sloviansk nine years ago when armed conflict first began in eastern Ukraine. The city of Poltava is now her home. With more displaced people coming to the city, she feels it’s her role to help welcome them.</p>



<p>Older people have been particularly affected by the war in Ukraine. Often living on limited incomes and already facing health issues, the stress of war and displacement, as well as family disruptions and loneliness, take a toll.</p>



<p>Starting life again in a new city is difficult.</p>



<p>“I had to leave my own home because I was responsible for my daughter, who was pregnant at the time, so it was dangerous for her to stay. My children and grandchildren are currently abroad. Since the full-scale invasion, I have been to several European countries, but I returned because Poltava is the best city for me and is now my hometown, the place where I always want to return to,” Maia says.</p>



<p>Maia’s hobby is also her passion – Nordic walking – a special workout that originated in Scandinavia and that promotes health through low-impact exercise. She’s used Nordic walking as a way to help other displaced older people find community and physical fitness in Poltava.</p>



<p>With funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, UNHCR and Ukrainian NGO CrimeaSOS host Maia’s class and other classes for displaced elders in the community.</p>



<p>They organized the “Golden Age” festival in Poltava. “Thanks to these events we have the opportunity to communicate, support each other, find new friends, and relax,” Maia explained.</p>



<p>The festival brought together 200 war-affected people over sixty. They met up and joined activities including Maia’s walking, dancing, painting and other crafts.</p>



<p>“I believe that my mission is to motivate people who have just left home to keep living on, not to close in and isolate, but help them try and adapt to new realities,” says Maia.</p>



<p>As of October 2023, Poltavska oblast was hosting over 186,000 internally displaced people. UNHCR has been contributing to the authorities’ efforts to receive people fleeing the hostilities by improving living conditions in collective sites, as well as promoting the inclusion of displaced people and supporting their ability to rebuild their lives and stay resilient.</p>



<p>This is made possible with support from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF).</p>

<p>Ukraine | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Ukraine, Kharkiv. </strong>The war in Ukraine continues to bring daily destruction across the country, severely impacting and disrupting the health-care sector. WHO has recorded over 1,300 attacks on health care since 24 February 2022.</p>



<p>To ensure continued access to primary health-care services in rural areas where facilities have been destroyed or irreparably damaged, WHO and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine have opened new, modular primary health-care clinics. The project is supported by the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and other donors.</p>



<p>Modular clinics can be assembled and installed in under two weeks, using prefabricated modules, depending on the required number of rooms. All clinics are equipped with essentials like electricity, sanitary facilities, sewage systems, waiting rooms and patient examination rooms. Generators and fans are provided to maintain an optimal environment.</p>



<p>The newly installed clinic in Tsyrkuny, staffed with three doctors, will be open six days per week to serve a community of more than 3,700 people. Consisting of eight modules – a fully functional medical facility – it replaces the village’s original outpatient clinic, which was destroyed in the spring of 2022.</p>



<p>The outpatient clinic for general practice and family medicine in the village of Hrakove is also replacing the dispensary destroyed last year. It will be staffed with a doctor and two nurses:the same people who worked in the original facility, ensuring continuity of care. The Hrakove clinic will serve around 300 people, open five days per week.</p>



<p>Given the facilities’ proximity to the contact line, WHO has equipped both clinics with a dedicated shelter nearby, providing a secure haven for ten people at a time.</p>



<p>Emanuele Bruni, the WHO Country Office Incident Manager, noted, “Modular facilities are incredibly nimble health-care units that can be quickly installed on the spot. These units are one of WHO’s key projects for response and recovery in Ukraine to ensure continued access to much-needed care for residents of rural communities and those returning home.”</p>



<p>He added, “While these facilities are ultimately a temporary solution, they are essential to bolstering trust in the health-care system and serving as replacements for damaged facilities for up to ten years.”  </p>

<p><strong>Ukraine, Donetsk region. </strong>“We used to have a lot of plans. Now we don’t plan anything,” says Mary, an engineer (not her real name), who lives in a village outside Chasiv Yar.</p>



<p>Chasiv Yar city is a few kilometers from the front line in Donetsk regio<strong>n</strong>. People here, and in the surrounding villages, face a dire situation. There are no utilities and commercial products in the city or nearby settlements. Even though there are ways to be evacuated and find other accommodation, some people still decide to stay in this extremely hostile environment to be with vulnerable loved ones, farm animals, and belongings.</p>



<p>Most of the time, the people who stay are elderly or living with disabilities; they don’t want to live in collective centers but would rather stay in their own homes and hope that the war won’t reach them.</p>



<p>Mary’s elderly father, for example, doesn’t want to move. “It’s not possible to stay here. It’s very dangerous. But he doesn’t want to go anywhere. I don’t know what to do in this situation.”</p>



<p>With no communications or utilities, even lighting a fire for warmth or cooking is dangerous. For this reason, ACTED and Ukrainian organization Save Peace, with funding from the UHF, are &nbsp;helping the most vulnerable people remaining in these areas with ready-to-eat food.</p>



<p>Each kit contains 20 rations, like porridge with meat, vegetables and a dessert. The food does not need cooking, which is safer for the people here. It allows people to have ready-to-eat food supplies for about 10 days, in case hostilities intensify and they can’t leave the shelter.</p>



<p>“My older daughter lives in Dnipro and we are here with my younger one for now,” says Natalia in Toretsk city, which is about 7km from the front line. <strong>“</strong>Help with any kind of food is very important to us - a little goes a long way in saving money. We want to move to Dnipro or Zaporizhzhya,” she adds.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine, Kharkivka, Mykolaivska, and Khersonska oblasts.</strong> The war has devastated Ukraine’s agriculture and food production, disrupted supply chains, and increased production costs for small farmers.</p>



<p>According to <a href=""https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099184503212328877/pdf/P1801740d1177f03c0ab180057556615497.pdf"">the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment</a> published in February 2023, Ukraine’s production of grain and oilseed decreased by 37 per cent in 2022. <a href=""https://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/news-archive/detail-news/en/c/1640738/"">Almost 90&nbsp;per cent of small-scale crop producers surveyed by FAO reported a fall in revenue</a> because of the war, and one in four reported having stopped or significantly reduced their agricultural activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For farmers who <em>can</em> access their land, making sure the land is safe is critical. &nbsp;“Many families and small-scale farmers in front-line regions are not planting this season because they know their fields are dangerous or they are risking their lives to plant on mined land or contaminated soil,” noted Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine .</p>



<p>With funding from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) launched a joint program in collaboration with mine action partner Fondation Suisse de Déminage (FSD) to support smallholder farmers and rural families most affected by the war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FAO, WFP, and FSD, working closely with local communities and authorities, and Ukraine's Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, have a multi-step plan. First, they will use satellite imagery to find and map areas in need of de-mining.</p>



<p>Then, de-mining teams will clear these areas of mines and other dangerous war remnants, focusing on those that can be quickly made safe. In the third step, FAO and FSD will test the soil for pollution from exploded weapons.</p>



<p>At the same time, FAO and WFP will talk to small farmers and rural families to understand what they need to restart farming. They will provide direct support, either in goods or cash, wherever possible.</p>



<p>“Making the land safe and free of explosive remnants of the war is the first step to rebuilding resilient and prosperous rural communities in Ukraine, who have been on the front lines of this war, and preventing their long-term dependence on humanitarian assistance,” said Denise Brown, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine. </p>



<p>The project has been supported by the <a href=""https://www.unocha.org/ukraine/about-uhf"">Ukraine Humanitarian Fund</a>, as well as other donors.&nbsp;With full support, FAO and WFP estimate $60 million in direct community food assistance could be saved.</p>

<p>Colombia, Chocó. “I came to the safe space because of violence. Another woman recommended I come,” says Elbidelia. “I spoke with other women who had experienced what I did.”</p>



<p>The humanitarian situation in Colombia has deteriorated, with about 7.7 million people needing humanitarian assistance in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Colombia still grapples with overlapping humanitarian challenges, particularly in areas where State presence and capacity are limited. These arise from the expanding geographical impact of internal armed conflict, its intensification in some areas, and ongoing climate-related disasters. High inflation and economic problems continue.</p>



<p>Chocó is one of the provinces worst affected by the armed conflict and indigenous communities like Elbidelia’s bear the brunt. As displacement throws the usual social order into turmoil, many women face an increased risk of gender-based violence – but lack the resources to access help.</p>



<p>With funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund, UNFPA is supporting women-friendly spaces that offer holistic support to mitigate the risk of, and respond to, gender-based violence.</p>



<p>Elbidelia explains, “What happens is that with indigenous women it is very difficult to talk about the topic.” She found that sharing her experience and hearing those of other women helped, and together they were able to find ways to change people’s ways of thinking and acting.</p>



<p>The safe spaces provide confidential support for managing cases of gender-based violence (GBV) and offering psychosocial care. They guide adolescents and women through discussions, workshops, and training sessions.</p>



<p>The space also provides livelihoods training to help women start afresh and find new avenues for earning money and empowerment through that.</p>



<p>“When I arrived, I didn't know how to weave. I didn't know how to do anything, but some of the other women taught me. From there I started weaving, and I’m now selling what I make to support my kids,” says Elbidelia.</p>

<p><strong>Nigeria, Adawama state. </strong>Thirteen years on, the conflict in Nigeria’s north-east states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe continues.</p>



<p>Conflict is driving a humanitarian and protection crisis affecting millions of people – including two million people who have been displaced over the years of fighting.</p>



<p>A major attack by a non-state armed group in June 2022 displaced many people within Adawama state, stretching basic services even further.</p>



<p>Alongside the displacement, gender-based violence is rising. The humanitarian crisis raises the risk of GBV; as people are separated from their communities and families, norms are disrupted, which can lead to more violence.</p>



<p>With funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund, the Nigerian organization Royal Heritage Health Foundation opened two One Stop Centres in Mubi South and Michika local government areas. These Centres offer counselling, medical support, and connections to justice for women dealing with violence.</p>



<p>The programme also trained healthcare providers on clinical management of rape and law enforcement on how to respond appropriately.</p>



<p>“The impact of this project has been significant, bringing about positive changes in the community, empowering survivors, raising awareness and creating a safety culture. We have fostered lasting change through collaborative efforts, transforming lives and building a more resilient and inclusive society,” explained the programme lead, Adewunmi Soyege.</p>



<p>Moreover, the project engaged with Women Committee Leaders in community awareness talks. During their quarterly women's forum, they committed to advocating for change in societal norms and eliminating gender-based violence in their communities.</p>



<p>This commitment was shared by a leader from Mubi North, who explained, “We have witnessed a tangible change. More women are reporting violence, they are accessing justice and connecting with other women survivors of violence.”</p>



<p>‘M’ is one woman who was able to find justice with the support of the Centre.</p>



<p>M was on her way home from studying for exams when she was attacked by a man posing as a security guard. With her aunt, she went to a One Stop Centre for support, where she received medical help and connected with authorities to report the crime.</p>



<p>In M's case, the perpetrator was actually apprehended: although this is unfortunately not always the case, this was a positive outcome..</p>

<p>CAR | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Central African Republic, Baga displacement site. &nbsp;</strong>Reine will soon be ten years old. Baga displacement site, where she lives, will soon be ten years old as well.</p>



<p>Conditions here remain very difficult. While Reine has access to essential health care and attends school, her parents lack opportunities to make a livelihood. And Reine has never lived in a permanent shelter, or knew the village life her parents grew up in.</p>



<p>At the height of the conflict in CAR, back in 2014, Reine’s parents fled to Baga, seeking safety. Ten years later, 489,000 people in CAR remain internally displaced – and 500 of them live in Baga displacement site. Some people want help to return home, while others fear going back.</p>



<p>Reine is in fourth grade and dreams of a career in health care. As an older sister, she worries about the health and wellbeing of her younger siblings. “I’m going to look after them. That’s why I’d like to work in a hospital.”</p>



<p>Emmanuel Mokpême has a son Reine’s age. He worries for his son’s mental health. “I find him lonely, sometimes aggressive. I think this could be linked to the environment in which he’s growing up. It’s the lack of landmarks, games, role models, of normal day to day life,” he explains.</p>



<p><em>A difficult decision</em></p>



<p>For now, Reine and Edouard’s parents have decided to stay put. Like many, they feel they have nothing left at their places of origin. “We no longer have a house. Going back is no longer possible,” explains Sabé Isaï, who lives at Baga site.</p>



<p>While some families decided to return home, they lack the resources to resettle. Their houses have been looted or simply become dilapidated.</p>



<p>Support for voluntary returns is a critical goal of the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan.</p>



<p>The CAR Humanitarian Fund has disbursed over $2.6 million to support&nbsp; these efforts, working with UN agencies, local, and international organizations. Since the year began, some 4,600 households received help re-establishing their lives in their places of origin, including through shelter, improved and rehabilitated water and sanitation, and essential household items. Income generation activities have also been supported.</p>

<p>Yemen | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Yemen, Al Bayda.</strong> <strong>“</strong>After the displacement, we were surviving on one meal a day,” explains Zainab, a mother of five. She lives in a displacement site in As Sawadiyah district in Al Bayda governorate, having fled her home in 2017.</p>



<p>Six years on, life remains difficult. The family still lives in a tent, which is well-worn and was never meant to serve as long-term shelter.</p>



<p>Zainab wakes up every morning early to collect plastic bottles to wash and re-sell. It provides a meager addition to the other assistance she receives, but it helps.</p>



<p>With funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, Relief and Development Peer Foundation provided cash transfers aimed to help Zeinab and 500 vulnerable families, to improve their food security.</p>



<p>The cash can be used however people wish, giving them the flexibility to buy what they need – like food, household goods, or home repairs – or to settle debts.</p>



<p>The YHF has emerged as a critical source of direct funding for Yemeni organizations, with 43% of funding allocated to national frontline responders in 2022, nearly double the previous year's percentage, and 41.33% so far in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Yemen, Al Taif district.</strong> When Ali fled his home in conflict-affected Hodeida four years ago, he expected to find safety for his family.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the conflict followed him – the town where they sought shelter was completely cut off from supplies. There was no diesel, and in time the water pumping system and tanks broke down.</p>



<p>The family had to wake up early and go to a well thirty minutes away. And even this well sometimes had no water. “People got sick because of the lack of clean water. It was a hard life,” Ali explains.</p>



<p>With funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, UN-Habitat provided emergency water and sanitation services to displaced people like Ali in Ad-Durayhimi and Bayt al Faqih districts. The project improved water and sanitation for host communities and the displaced people sheltering there.</p>



<p>UN-Habitat rehabilitated eight critical water sources, installing solar-powered pumping, improved pipes, and better water testing kits.</p>



<p>People in the community learned how to manage and repair the new facilities, and a group of women were trained in hygiene practices so they could in turn share information with their peers.</p>



<p>“Now with the improved latrines and water, things have improved tremendously. People’s privacy is restored and our community is much cleaner,” Ali explains.</p>

<p><strong>Yemen, Ta’iz governorate. </strong>Bakil is twelve years old. He enjoys school but was finding it difficult to focus. His classroom in Ta’iz lacked seats and it was hard to concentrate while sitting on the floor.</p>



<p>His father made a chair for him to bring to school – he could see better, but he still needed a desk to write on.</p>



<p>Years of conflict have weakened Yemen’s education system. Thousands of schools were destroyed, damaged, or used for shelter and safety rather than schooling.</p>



<p>The net result? Nearly 2.7 million children are out of school, and those who do manage to attend school – like Bakil - struggle due to poor facilities and lack of resources.</p>



<p>Supported by the Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF), the Social Development Hodeida Girls Foundation (SdHGF) made some improvements to Bakil’s school and others in Al Makha district.</p>



<p>They provided essential supplies including school desks, and rehabilitated classrooms, toilets, and teachers’ incentives for schools throughout the area.</p>



<p>For Bakil, having a comfortable seat and a desk to write on makes daily lessons more comfortable. “I felt I’m really learning,” he said.</p>



<p>His teacher explained that now he could move from student to student and better explain the lessons, compared to when the kids had to sit on the floor.</p>



<p>It’s a small thing in a challenging situation, but it makes a difference.</p>



<p>The YHF has emerged as a critical source of direct funding for Yemeni organizations, with 43% of funding allocated to national frontline responders in 2022, nearly double the previous year's percentage, and 41.33% so far in 2023.</p>

<p>Somalia | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Somalia, Dollow</strong>. Mama Fatuma Gurham is a vendor in the marketplace in Dollow. Recently, she and other vendors were visited by women from the community who shared information on how to prevent water-borne disease and to keep themselves, customers, and families safe from illness.</p>



<p>“This information was very useful,” says Mama Fatuma.</p>



<p>After extensive flooding in the 2023 Deyr rainy seasons - October-December last year, water infrastructure in many affected areas of Somalia has been destroyed, and even the wells that still worked have been contaminated.</p>



<p>With the water infrastructure damaged or destroyed, many people displaced by the floods also lack access to safe water.</p>



<p>With funding from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, Somali organization Nomadic Assistance for Peace and Development (NAPAD) has trained thirty community hygiene promoters in Qurdubey, Busle, Garbolow, and in the Dollow Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) sites, including those at Ladan, Kaharey, Kabasa, and Qansaxlay.</p>



<p>The trainers learn how to reduce the risk and transmission of watery diseases like cholera, for example by promoting hygiene and hand washing, spreading the word on safe treatment and storage of household water, and improving latrine maintenance.</p>



<p>The Community Health Promoters conducted door-to-door hygiene promotion for a month. And they continue to run information sessions in community locations like the marketplaces and tea shops.</p>



<p>They use posters and easy-to-remember, engaging messages to convey important hygiene information. These methods communicate vital messages about sanitation, handwashing, water safety, insect control, and flood preparedness.</p>



<p>For their work, the health promoters receive a monthly stipend.</p>



<p>Abshiro Hassan Bashir, the leader of CHPS in Kabasa displacement camp, noted that, ""We are educating people in different settings about proper hygiene and sanitation, and emphasizing the importance of positive behavior change to enhance hygiene practices.""</p>



<p>Together, they have reached over 1,000 people with this critical information.</p>

<p>Somalia | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Somalia, Alle Suge displacement site. </strong> When you have to flee your home,  there may not be enough time to grab essentials.</p>



<p>With support from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund, women and girls in the Deynille displacement camp were able to obtain dignity kits from NoFYL, a Somali organization.</p>



<p>These include soap, underwear, and a shawl, as well as menstrual supplies.</p>



<p>“Everything here is useful,” said Muuno. “Even the bag was handy for shopping at the market.”</p>



<p>For Ramlo and her adolescent daughter, “the menstrual pads were the best things. Previously we had to use old clothes or fabric. I’m happy that will change.”</p>



<p>Like many girls who can’t afford supplies, Qeyro was missing school when she had her period, as she couldn’t afford sanitary products. The kit makes a difference. “It helped me feel more like myself again. It’s made my life a little bit easier.”</p>



<p>NoFYL brought groups of women and girls together to talk about reproductive health and gender-based violence. They also discussed how to use the various menstruation supplies.</p>



<p>Safiya says, “I realized I had been using some items in the wrong way, so this was useful. But it would be even better to involve us before the distribution so that they know the type of items we require. I would have loved to see shoes and Hijab included in the kits,” she added.</p>

<p><strong>Syria and Türkiye| 2023|CBPF</strong> <strong>and CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Syria and </strong><strong>Türkiye</strong>. On 6 February 2023, a series of major earthquakes rocked Syria and Türkiye. Nearly 5,900 people died and over 12,800 were injured.</p>



<p>People already facing dire conditions after years of war lost what little they had – again. Families lost loved ones, at a time when a worsening economic situation already meant many could not meet their basic needs.</p>



<p>In the immediate aftermath of the quake, OCHA swiftly allocated money from the pooled funds – the Central Emergency Response Fund, the Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund, and the Syria Humanitarian Fund - to kick start immediate humanitarian response and continue to help people in the following months.</p>



<p>In Syria, the earthquakes uprooted hundreds of thousands of families, who had already lived through twelve years of conflict. Syrian refugees and Turkish host community members were also affected. Rojin, a Syrian woman <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/turkiye/3-months-earthquakes-5-reasons-women-and-girls-syria-and-turkiye-still-need-your-support"">displaced in Türkiye</a>, explained, “We stayed outside in the park for four days. We couldn’t take anything with us, nothing for the children, no shoes. The situation was very difficult.”</p>



<p><em>Clearing debris, providing immediate help</em></p>



<p>OCHA’s pooled funds enabled partners to provide immediate help. The Syria Cross- border Humanitarian Fund helped UNDP to <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/turkiye/100-days-later-view-turkiye-and-syria"">clear debris</a> – essential work that also created temporary jobs for affected people and increased humanitarian access by clearing roads for transport.</p>



<p>Already existing projects for food and education were re-purposed to provide emergency food assistance and education. In Idleb, local organizations distributed bread to affected households and provided water testing and water trucking to ensure safe water was available.</p>



<p><em>Helping families access safe water and health care</em></p>



<p>Mounfed recalled the night of the quake. She lives with her three children. “The night of the earthquake, my family and I were asleep. Fear, fear, fear – I get goosebumps just thinking about it,” she says. “I woke up to the building shaking and the children calling out for me.”</p>



<p>Her home was destroyed, and in the following weeks she stayed in a shelter inside a school in Aleppo, sharing a room with another family.</p>



<p>Thousands of people like Mounfed sought shelter in collective centres in schools and other locations in Aleppo – in the middle of winter. <a href=""https://www.medair.org/stories/my-guiding-light-a-mothers-story-from-the-earthquake-in-syria/"">Through funding from the Syria Humanitarian Fund (SHF), Medair supplied about 50,000L of water</a> to people in the affected areas in Aleppo including Mounfed and her family.</p>



<p><em>Community Iftars provide respite</em></p>



<p>The earthquake came just before the month of Ramadan, observed by many affected people. <a href=""https://twitter.com/IOMTurkiye/status/1670672766016831492/photo/2"">Alongside other psychosocial support activities</a>, CERF funding contributed to thirty-five community Iftars, implemented by partner IOM and the Hatay Metropolitan Municipality in Türkiye<em>.</em></p>



<p>These brought together 7,000 people, including Syrian refugees and affected host community members. For many, the Iftars offered a social occasion that provided a bit of normalcy for themselves and their children.</p>



<p>“We feel better being here together with other people. It’s also about changing the scene and environment as we are in a tent all the time. We can socialize here,” said Zehra, a mother originally from Syria.</p>



<p><em>Rebuilding damaged homes</em></p>



<p>Mohamed is a returnee to Dorien, a rural community in Syria. His house was looted during the war, and then rendered uninhabitable by the earthquake.</p>



<p>Here and in other rural communities, the <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/hope-resilience-and-new-beginning"">Syria Humanitarian Fund worked with Syrian NGO GOPA to repair damaged homes</a>.</p>



<p>The GOPA project repaired his house so that his family could live there again. “Why did I return? It’s where I was born and lived my entire life…it is my home,” he explains.</p>



<p><em>Supporting rural livelihoods and food security</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, in Salqoin, Idleb governorate, the Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund supported Qatar Red Crescent Society work to <a href=""https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/29/03/2023/qrcs-expands-irrigation-projects-in-northern-syria"">lay critical irrigation pipelines and rehabilitate damaged wells.</a></p>



<p>The project created jobs and built the groundwork for sustainable agriculture in vulnerable villages, supporting food security into the future.</p>



<p><em>Needs continue this winter</em></p>



<p>Of the people displaced by the earthquake as well as by other crises, some 800,000 are still living in tents, many of them for years. During the winter, these tents are people’s only shelter from the snow, freezing rain, and high winds.</p>



<p>As part of the Winter Response, the Syria Cross-border Humanitarian Fund allocated $9.5 million specifically for winterization activities: the funding helps move people out of tents and into dignified, durable shelters.</p>



<p>By mid-December 2023, over 28,500 families – or 35 per cent of the target of 81,520 - have so far been supported into dignified shelter, and another 7,000 families are also being helped. But there’s not enough funding to move all the families who need to move</p>



<p>“For the cost of two tents - which have to be replaced every six months - we'd like to provide a dignified shelter, providing more privacy, more durability and lasting much longer,” said David Carden, UN Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis (DRHC), <a href=""https://twitter.com/UN/status/1727018693924880634"">in a UN interagency visit to Idleb</a> last November.</p>

<p><strong>occupied Palestinian territory, Gaza.&nbsp; </strong>Since Ayla was born in early October 2023, her mother’s <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/sop/stories/being-mother-gaza-strip-story-resilience-and-determination"">focus has been on keeping her safe and healthy.</a> But, as the intense bombardment from air, land, and sea continues, it has been difficult to do so.</p>



<p><a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-4-february-2024-2359"">People are hungry.</a> Nearly one million people face emergency levels of food insecurity (Phase 4); with a further 378,000 in Phase 5, facing extreme lack of food, starvation, and exhaustion of coping capacities.</p>



<p>People have lost their homes. About 1.7 million people <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-4-february-2024-2359"">– three-quarters of the population</a> – have fled their homes because of the conflict. About 60 per cent of civilian housing has been destroyed as well as other critical infrastructure and essential services like hospitals or clean water supply.</p>



<p>Yasmina had planned to exclusively breastfeed Ayla, but now she herself cannot find enough to eat.</p>



<p>“Finding nutritious food is a daily struggle, and it's affecting Ayla's feeding. We can barely find the minimum,” she explained. Yasmina adds that she has to supplement with formula – which is not always available, and costs over six dollars per box when it is.</p>



<p>The water she and her husband can find isn’t clean, so she boils it – and Ayla doesn’t like the taste of her formula with this water.</p>



<p>And at night, the sounds of bombing keep her and the baby awake. “It is terrifying. I hug and shield her with my body, fearing for her safety from breaking &nbsp;glass and collapsing buildings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>OCHA’s Pooled Funds – the Central Emergency Response Fund and the oPt Humanitarian Fund – are helping humanitarian organizations to respond to some of the needs Yasmina and Ayla face, alongside millions like them, while hostilities continue.</p>



<p><em>Immediate assistance through our local partners</em></p>



<p>Since 7 October, the <a href=""https://www.ochaopt.org/page/opt-humanitarian-fund/about-opt-humanitarian-fund"">occupied Palestinian Territories Humanitarian Fund</a> has disbursed about $55 million to <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-109-enarhe"">respond to urgent needs in Gaza</a>.</p>



<p>The most recent allocation in December allocated some $40 million to urgently help people in Gaza by providing hot meals, water bottles, basic hygiene supplies, and emergency reproductive healthcare.</p>



<p>Non-governmental organization <a href=""https://www.maan-ctr.org/files/server/Flash-Updates/4-OCHA.pdf"">Ma’an Development Center</a> distributed emergency supplies and fresh drinking water. They also delivered winter jackets and blankets, as well as essential supplies like baby wipes and diapers and hygiene supplies for all ages, in parts of Rafah, Khan-Younes, and Middle Areas.</p>



<p>Ma’an also provided affected people sheltering in schools and their homes with drinking water – <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=753631256810002&amp;id=100064894021328&amp;mibextid=WC7FNe"">over 2 million liters</a> in a recent distribution.</p>



<p>Other Humanitarian Fund partners – Palestinian and international – continue to provide immediate assistance.</p>



<p>At the same time, the <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/what-we-do/allocation/2023/summary/23-RR-PSE-61504"">Central Emergency Response Fund allocated US $12 million</a> in October through its Rapid Response mechanism, directing funding for healthcare, food, water, sanitation, and shelter – aiming to reach about 372,000 people. This funding is helping provide displaced people with ready-to-eat meals, and household supplies. It’s also supporting water service providers with operational and maintenance materials and water trucks, and getting essential medical supplies, fuel, and equipment for Gaza’s battered health system.</p>



<p>For example, with support from CERF and other donors<a href=""https://www.unicef.org/sop/stories/being-mother-gaza-strip-story-resilience-and-determination"">, UNICEF dispatched life-saving medicines and equipment to the Gaza Strip,</a> including supplies for mothers and newborns, like baby Ayla. And UNICEF is also making sure that children affected by the conflict are getting <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/sop/stories/routine-vaccines-are-saving-children-lives"">essential routine vaccinations</a>.</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Tyre. </strong>Inas has been living in a school shelter with her husband and children since October. The family was displaced due to heavy bombardment near their home near the southern border. They haven’t had a chance to visit their house since then, and don’t know if it’s been destroyed.</p>



<p>Mahmoud, a father of five, was also displaced from the area. He and his five children are staying in a collective shelter in Tyre. He’s also lost his job. “Leaving your home unwillingly feels like losing your dignity,” he says.</p>



<p>Since 8 October, increased hostilities at the southern border between armed groups and Israel have driven internal displacement in Lebanon.  <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/lebanon-glance-escalation-hostilities-south-lebanon-01-february-2024-enar"">By late January, over 86,600 people</a> had fled from their homes, sheltering with friends and family or in collective shelters set up in schools.</p>



<p>Even before the latest hostilities, Lebanon faced a severe economic crisis that was affecting all residents.</p>



<p>More than half of the country’s population of 5.8 million now depend on humanitarian assistance for food and basic needs. More than 1.2 million people need support to access safe water and sanitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasing tensions in the south and displacement have compounded the needs of many already vulnerable people. The Lebanon Humanitarian Fund is supporting Lebanese and international humanitarian organizations.</p>



<p><em>Mobile health care and psychosocial support.</em></p>



<p>Lebanese organization Amel, with funding from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, is helping to provide crucial healthcare , including mental health support through its medical mobile unit in Tyre.</p>



<p>This initiative is coordinated closely with the municipality and the disaster management unit, ensuring a comprehensive response to the healthcare needs of the people affected. Amel is also distributing household items.” With this holistic approach, we aim to make a meaningful impact for those who need it the most,” explains Sahar Chokor, Health Field Coordinator for South Lebanon.</p>



<p><em>Immediate basic assistance – food, clean water, and shelter</em></p>



<p>Like Inas, Moussa is staying with his children in a collective shelter. For a wheelchair user, it’s been quite uncomfortable. “Instead of having a proper bed, I am sleeping on tables, which is physically exhausting and uncomfortable. These hardships significantly impact my quality of life and make daily activities even more challenging,” Moussa explains. &nbsp;Basic household goods – blankets, pillows, and the like, make things a bit easier. But it’s no replacement for home.</p>



<p>Another LHF partner, Action Against Hunger, is helping people with food and household supplies, including in Montana, the hotel in Zahrani that has become a shelter for displaced people like Moussa and his family.</p>



<p>LHF funding helps ACF to provide hot breakfast, mattresses, pillows blankets, and essential household supplies for the families sheltering there.</p>



<p>Despite the uncertainty and worry, Mahmoud, who is here with his children after staying with relatives in Beirut for a few weeks, says, “Knowing the people that are here makes the displacement a bit easier.”</p>



<p>In addition, ACF has supported safe spaces for women and awareness sessions to combat gender-based violence, a risk that often increases in times of conflict and uncertainty. “Women must know how to defend themselves,” explains Randa Kaddoura, a program officer with ACF.</p>



<p>The funding also supports a specialized team to advise pregnant and breastfeeding women in the shelters.</p>



<p><em>Education kits, livelihood support, and winter supplies</em></p>



<p>The fighting at the border has been going on for three months and displaced people’s needs are evolving. Critical initial needs – for household supplies and food – are no longer as urgent, and longer-term problems come into view.</p>



<p>People are saying they need sustainable assistance, including to address the loss of income due to leaving their jobs, as well as for the children who have stopped attending school.</p>



<p>Amale is 12 years old. “I miss the joy of studying, especially my favorite subject which is English literature,” she says.</p>



<p>With funds from LHF, World Vision has supported displaced families with educational kits so that children can continue learning even though they are not home yet. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The future remains uncertain</em></p>



<p>For those displaced, the uncertainty remains. “Our future is mysterious,” says Mahmoud, “we don’t know where we are headed.”</p>



<p>""We feel adrift, lacking a clear vision for the future, and my children are similarly affected, despite their tender age and limited understanding of the circumstances,” explains Inas.</p>



<p>“My greatest fear is the further escalation of war and witnessing harm befall my children,” says Moussa. “My hope is for a peaceful resolution that allows us to return to our homes with dignity, putting an end to the ongoing conflict.”</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2023 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Tripoli. </strong>A cholera outbreak was declared in Lebanon in October 2022. Ali, a Syrian refugee, and father of two-year-old Ahmad, explained how frightened he was when his son started getting sick. “Ahmad was severely dehydrated and suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting. He was hospitalized in Tripoli for about a week.”</p>



<p>UNHCR supported the national cholera response plan, led by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and working closely with the Government, UN agencies, and NGOs, UNHCR helped implement the Nationwide National Oral Cholera Vaccination campaign. By February 2023, over one million single doses of the oral cholera vaccine had been administered. More than 60% of the beneficiaries were Lebanese, and the rest were Syrian.</p>



<p>“This is about saving lives. With the support of our partners, we were able to deliver vaccinations to the most vulnerable, which helped contain the cholera outbreak and safeguard entire communities in the most difficult-to-reach places,” says Dr. Zinia Sultana, UNHCR Senior Public Health Officer.</p>



<p>The “Dr. Abdullah El Rassi” Governmental Hospital was the first to receive Cholera patients and UNHCR supported the initial hospital emergency response as well as the conversion of COVID-19 facilities into a Cholera Treatment Center.</p>



<p>“When families and individuals began being admitted to the hospital, UNHCR started planning and coordination efforts with us to convert the facilities into a cholera treatment center. Their support was crucial at such a critical and incredibly challenging time,” says Dr. Atik.</p>



<p>The response was even broader:&nbsp;250 vaccination teams were&nbsp;mobilized for door-to-door vaccine provision and community engagement. Over 500 UNHCR Outreach Volunteers were&nbsp;trained in&nbsp;awareness raising, information sharing,&nbsp;and&nbsp;surveillance&nbsp;in high-risk locations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty nurses were deployed nationwide in humanitarian partner Rapid Response Teams; while 200 cholera beds were&nbsp;procured so that hospitals had the capacity to admit severe cases. UNHCR also covered&nbsp;100% of hospital costs&nbsp;for all suspected and confirmed cases among&nbsp;refugee patients.</p>



<p>Ahmad’s father Ali says, “I truly believe the treatment he received was lifesaving because it was administered in a hospital with a specific Cholera Treatment Center,” referencing the Tripoli Government Hospital. Ahmad has fully recovered, and Ali is thankful he vaccinated his son: “The vaccine will ensure this illness never threatens my son’s life again.”</p>



<p>The generous contribution of the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and other donors, to the cholera response in Lebanon enabled UNHCR to carry out these lifesaving interventions. CERF, ‘a fund for all, by all’, ensured that urgently needed humanitarian assistance reached the most vulnerable people in their time of need.</p>

<p><strong>Somalia: Iftin and Habal Aday displacement sites.</strong> “I love coming here,” says Zaituna, who is 12 years old, of the child-friendly space at Iftin displacement site. “It’s a happy place – the drawing sessions are my favourite. It feels like I’m bringing my dreams to life on paper.”</p>



<p>While Somalia managed to walk back from the brink of famine in late 2022 and early 2023, close to four million people continue to be food insecure and in need of assistance, including millions of internally displaced people like Zaituna who have fled their homes due to conflict and the ravages of climate change.</p>



<p>More than 80 per cent of displaced people are women and children, who face significant protection risks. Child-friendly spaces offer an opportunity for normalcy for vulnerable children, some of whom are unaccompanied and living without their families.<strong></strong></p>



<p>With support from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), local Somali organization NoFYL is supporting child-friendly spaces in several displacement sites, for Zaituna and other children like her. There, children can do art, play football, and enjoy other activities in a safe space.</p>



<p>These children are living through difficult times. But the games provide some respite and new connections with other young people.</p>



<p>Abdirahman is 14. He says, ""The floods destroyed everything, and playing again with old and new friends feels different. It's not just a game; it's like leaving all the tough stuff behind and just having fun with friends.""</p>



<p>Nasra Ali, a case worker with NoFYL, observes, “Every smile, every kick of the football, every happy cry, is a step towards healing.”</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine. </strong>When war reached Kharkiv in February 2022, Nadiia took shelter in the basement of her former home. <strong>“</strong>It was very cold and humid in the basement, but it was the only way to survive,” Nadiia described.</p>



<p>“We were barely living in there.” Even so, she continued to teach her students online.</p>



<p>Unable to cope with the worsening living conditions, she eventually fled to western Ukraine with her elderly mother and her adult daughter.</p>



<p>While sadly Nadiia’s mother died soon after the journey, Nadiia and her daughter live in the Svaliava collective displacement site.</p>



<p>Ukrainian organization Proliska has installed an information center for the displaced people – providing internet access, computers and a printer - with the support of the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>Children and adults can now organize and access various online educational activities, including distance learning, online courses, video lectures, and conferences. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new facility also means residents can access psychological and medical support, consultations on social and legal issues, and social support services provided by NGO and local authority mobile teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was high demand for an information center like this, a Proliska team member explained. “Now children can study online, and adults can earn some money working online. It opens up a lot of opportunities.”</p>



<p>Nadiia continues teaching English and philosophy online.</p>



<p>She also can pursue her own learning and interests. “I participate in international seminars and conferences,” she explained. She also sees how children in the center enjoy the space. “They love to play and learn here. They attend art and music therapy. In the past two years, they’ve lived through a lot.”</p>

<p>Afghanistan | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Afghanistan, Herat province. </strong>On a cold winter morning, 21-year-old Shokria visited a WHO-supported health centre close to her home in Herat province, western Afghanistan. She waited with a dozen other women from the area to see a doctor and her name was called after a short wait.</p>



<p>Afghanistan grapples with a fragile healthcare system and unequal access to services. Funding is insufficient and there is a shortage of healthcare professionals, leading to disease and unmet primary care needs. To make matters worse, Shokria’s village in Injil district was directly affected by the earthquakes last October. Throughout the region, many houses were destroyed and several schools and health centres damaged.</p>



<p>“Since our houses are damaged, we have been living in tents or temporary shelters,” Shokria said. “With high winds, it can get very cold in my place.”</p>



<p>With funding from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, WHO has set up eight health centres across four districts in Herat to provide vulnerable communities with critical health services.<strong> &nbsp;</strong>Before the centre opened, people had to travel far to access assistance. “I would have been forced to deal with my health issues by myself at home,” said Shokria. “The new health centre gives us all hope.”</p>



<p><strong>Supporting quality care</strong></p>



<p>The funding from AHF helped Herat Regional Hospital build up its stock of essential medicines and provide patients with high-quality care – including medicine and meals. The funding also supported training for dealing with mass casualty events like the earthquake.</p>



<p>Qamar was admitted to hospital with a broken leg and head injuries after an accident. “At this hospital, I received medication, food, and fruit. And there was no cost for me. I’m really happy with the service and the doctors.”</p>



<p><strong>A hospital run by women for women</strong></p>



<p>Run by women exclusively for female patients and their children, the Sakena Yakoobi Hospital in Herat provides essential gynecological and pediatric health care.</p>



<p>With funding from the AHF, the World Health Organization has been helping provide life-saving health care for 5,000-6,000 patients each month. “In just one year, this hospital has gained the trust of the community. This is because we consistently deliver quality health care,” explains Dr. Homa Niksiar, the hospital director.</p>



<p>Patients have noticed the high-quality care and spread the word to their friends and neighbors. Gamila accessed care here throughout her pregnancy. “A relative recommended it based on her own positive delivery experience. On her advice, I came here when I was three months pregnant and I followed up with check-ups. I was impressed by the quality of care and my doctor’s excellent communication, which made it easier to decide to have my baby here.”</p>



<p><strong>Needs are huge</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Faridoon Sultani, Regional Manager at the Organization for Community Coordination and Development (OCCD), WHO’s partner in Herat province, said health centres supported by WHO are functioning in eight earthquake-affected areas. “The health centres have professional staff and are supplied with adequate equipment and medicines. They see patients every day from morning till dusk,” said Dr. Sultani.</p>



<p>“With support from WHO, we have delivered essential health services in all the earthquake-affected areas during the first 100 days,” Dr. Sultani added. “The new centres will continue delivering healthcare in the earthquake-affected areas for three months now, but with high needs I hope we can continue to support them in the longer term.”</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine. </strong>As Ukraine endures yet another new wave of attacks amid a harsh winter, humanitarian workers are tirelessly supporting the most affected people, especially in the eastern and southern regions.</p>



<p><strong>Winter supplies to keep the cold out</strong></p>



<p>Antonina Veryovka is a 69-year-old resident of Pervomaiske village, in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv region.</p>



<p>She shared her harrowing experience: “Everything was burned down completely. Windows, doors – everything was destroyed.” Her village was occupied for several days, and people hid in their basements.</p>



<p>Antonina was trying to rebuild her life, making do in her damaged home.</p>



<p>With support from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, Caritas and the Ukrainian organization Charitable Foundation New Dawn provided winter supplies, including a mattress, pillow, and thermal blanket. Her house isn’t fixed, but she says, “Now at least I have something to sleep on.”</p>



<p><strong>Firewood and stoves for cooking and heat</strong></p>



<p>In Hontarivka village, just 39 km from the border with Russia, Vira and her family were also struggling. With no central gas supply, they rely on firewood for heating – an expensive luxury.</p>



<p>“Have you seen the prices for firewood? Where will we get the money if a truck of firewood costs UAH15,000 (US$400)?” she asked. “There is no gas, there is no anything.”</p>



<p>Families like Vira’s received vital assistance from JERU (Joint Emergency Response in Ukraine, the joint mission of Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide) in partnership with the national organization “We are Brothers, We are Ukrainians.”&nbsp; The initiative received financial support from&nbsp;the Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>JERU provided a stove and firewood to Vira’s family and other affected people.</p>



<p>JERU’s Country Director, Derya Mutlu, said: “Wherever we have been, winter has always been the biggest concern for people; whether they will have enough money for heating, whether families will be able to provide themselves with the necessary amount of firewood and fuel, heat their homes and pay bills.” </p>

<p>Colombia | 2023 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Colombia,</strong><strong> Chocó region.</strong> Visitación Perea has been a midwife for nearly fifty years. As a young girl, she joined her grandmother – also a midwife – on her daily visits. In those days, sometimes births took place by candlelight.</p>



<p>Midwives are a fundamental part of this and other rural communities – providing advice and support to pregnant women and new mothers and serving as de-facto community leaders. “If the midwife is from the area, knows the community, and has been trained, she is seen as a mother, as a friend, as an aunt, as a mom to all,"" says Visitación.</p>



<p>To be a “<em>partera</em>” is to engage in a centuries-old tradition, accompanying women not just during birth but before and after, teaching them how to care for themselves, their babies, and encouraging them to visit the clinic when it’s needed.</p>



<p>Remembering those early visits with her grandmother, she says, ""I realized that this was my vocation, and since it is now my vocation, I love it! I’m blessed every day of my life... for me, it means life, tradition, culture.""</p>



<p>In this remote community, most people have to travel long distances to access health care. Roads are poorly maintained, and crime and violence remain a threat. Armed groups sometimes issue temporary curfews, meaning people aren’t allowed to move freely at night. Help from the local midwife can really be a matter of life or death.</p>



<p>A PAHO/WHO project, supported by CERF, worked with midwives like Visitación, who support conflict-affected rural communities, including in the indigenous, black, Afro-Colombian, Raizal, and Palenquera communities.</p>



<p>Midwives are on the frontlines of saving lives. The project aims to reduce avoidable illness and death for people affected by the conflict in this region. It brings the midwives together to share knowledge, learn new skills, and use new equipment (like scales to weigh newborns) at the Tutunendo health centre. A nursing assistant was also available for 24-hour consultations.</p>



<p>Visitación is a lifelong learner. Building on her deep experience, the training from PAHO taught her and her fellow <em>parteras</em> new warning signs and risk factors to look out for in her patients, for conditions like pre-eclampsia or placenta previa.</p>



<p>""We want to thank the United Nations for believing in us midwives. Thank you for believing in our region, and for sharing all that knowledge with us,"" she says. “We’ll put this new information into practice in areas where access to care is not easily available.”</p>

<p><strong>Burkina Faso and Niger</strong>. “Our garden used to provide us with enough food. But we lost everything,” says Roukietou, a mother of two in Banwa province, Burkina Faso, who had to flee her home because of &nbsp;violence.</p>



<p>In neighbouring Niger, Amna cried herself to sleep. Also displaced by conflict, she was suddenly forced to marry an older relative. “My dreams were shattered,” she said.</p>



<p>Mass displacement and conflict uproot people’s lives, leading to more risks for women and girls, including hunger and poor nutrition, as well as gender-based violence and sexual exploitation.</p>



<p>Burkina Faso continues to experience one of the fastest-growing humanitarian crises in the world, with an estimated ten per cent of the national population - more than two million people - internally displaced due to violence and insecurity. A quarter of the population is currently reliant on humanitarian aid.</p>



<p>In Niger, forced displacement has been triggered by conflict, malnutrition, recurrent health epidemics, cyclical floods and drought. It means that 4.3 million people, including 2.4 million children, need humanitarian assistance in 2024.</p>



<p><strong><em>Help to continue schooling.</em></strong></p>



<p>Amna and her family fled conflict in their village and made for a displacement site in Tillaberi. But, when Amna was only 12, she was married to her cousin, against her wishes. Then, at 14, she became pregnant.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Amna did leave. A friend advised her to get in touch with the international NGO Help, which offers services in Tillaberi with the support of the Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa.</p>



<p>Amna met a Help midwife as well as a mental health counsellor. She described her regrets about leaving school and, being pregnant, her worry that she wouldn’t be able to return. The midwife and counsellors told her they would help her to get back to school.</p>



<p>When the baby was born, Help provided food, hygiene supplies, clothes, and formula. The counsellor and baby nurses visited regularly to check on them and make sure they were well. With support from family members, Amna has been able to return to school. “I sleep well now,” she says.</p>



<p><strong><em>Knowledge, support, and leadership.</em></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>In Burkina Faso, the international NGO EngenderHealth hosted classes on nutrition, hygiene, and childcare for displaced women like Roukietou. They were also an opportunity to learn and connect with other women who had lived through similar experiences. “These were helpful, and I share the information with other women I know,” says Roukietou.</p>



<p>Another displaced woman, Rakieta, conducts awareness-raising campaigns in the community, advocating for women’s rights and decision-making.</p>



<p>A survivor of domestic abuse herself, Rakieta works with a project run by the national NGO SOS Sahel. “I suffered so much,” she explains. Now she works to get women involved in camp leadership and joining community committees, to help protect other women’s rights – so that no one has to live through what she did.</p>

<p><strong>South Sudan, Twic East. </strong>Devastating floods back in 2021 forced Clara*, her husband and four children to flee, leaving everything behind.</p>



<p>Clara was overwhelmed by the experience and the difficulty of life in the displacement camp. She and her husband had to borrow money just to feed the children. “Life was difficult in the camp, more difficult than living in the village. Sometimes I felt like ending my life,” she said.</p>



<p>Fast forward to 2024 and some nine million people need humanitarian assistance across South Sudan. Climate change drives dry spells as well as extreme floods like the one Clara experienced. And violence continues to drive displacement and protection risks, particularly for women and girls.</p>



<p>Whether displaced by climate or conflict, families are forced to start over, often with very little.</p>



<p>A few months after the floods, as she and her husband tried to rebuild, Clara heard about a women’s space in Twic East town and started visiting. The centre had funding support from the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund, and was run by Care International. Here she could speak with a counsellor and other women who had lived through similar experiences.</p>



<p>“I was able to talk openly and ask questions. I got answers from the other women, as well as the counsellor,” she explained. In time, those darker thoughts subsided.</p>



<p>Alongside the counselling and support, Clara and the other women could take classes in different skills that might help them earn money.</p>



<p>Clara and her group practised baking bread. As their skills and confidence grew, they used flour, oil, and ovens in the space to start a small bakery. With the proceeds, Clara joined the Village Saving and Loan, setting aside a small amount each week to put toward school fees and other essentials.</p>



<p>“Everything I learned at the centre, I put into practice,” Clara said.</p>



<p><em>Helping one another through difficult times</em></p>



<p>Sheila* became homeless when a violent conflict broke out in her village in late 2022. At the time, she had two sons and was pregnant with her third child. She and her children fled with no belongings.</p>



<p>The host community stepped in to help Sheila with food and the basics, despite having little to share.</p>



<p>A South Sudanese NGO, Youth Empowerment and Development Aid (YEDA), with funding from the SSHF, also provided mosquito nets, blankets, and kitchen sets. The people in the host community helped her build a simple shelter with plastic sheets and tentpoles. It was a start.</p>



<p>Sheila focused on getting her family settled and safe. And she did not forget those who helped her right at the start. She shared some of the kitchen supplies with the women who had welcomed her in those early, difficult days.</p>



<p>“We have supported each other, and this is why we can live peacefully together,” Sheila said. “When I first arrived here, I had nothing and nobody but my children. Now I can help others,” she added.</p>

<p>DRC | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>DRC, South Kivu.</strong> In May 2023, torrential rains struck Kalehe in South Kivu, in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, causing deadly floods and landslides.</p>



<p>DRC faces several complex humanitarian emergencies. This year, about 8.7 million people need urgent humanitarian assistance, stemming from a mix of ethnic, territorial, and resource-based conflicts, compounded by natural disasters like those major floods.</p>



<p>Hundreds of people died in Kalehe, and about 18,000 people were displaced from their homes. Aganze Lupenga, a young mother, was directly affected: her house, like nearly 3,000 others, was destroyed, leaving her family homeless.</p>



<p>Alongside her own children, Aganze also had to care for the children of a relative who died in the floods. She had lost all her possessions and her home, and had many children to feed. ""I had been living a very difficult life. I lived under tarpaulins with the children and when it rained, it was tough.""</p>



<p>In the days following the deluge, the DRC Humanitarian Fund launched a USD 3 million Reserve Allocation to help the affected people.</p>



<p>With funding from this allocation, Congolese NGO RHA (Rebuild Hope for Africa) provided affected families with shelters and essential household items. Aganze was among the 3,000 people who got metal roofing sheets and nails, essential materials to construct basic shelters, as well as household supplies and clothing.</p>



<p>With the roofing sheets, Aganze built a simple plank house, offering her family a modest yet secure shelter, but more than that, a step towards normality. The household supplies – blankets, pots and pans, and warm clothes – helped Aganze and the children start to feel this could become a home.</p>



<p>Freed from the worry of safe shelter, Aganze was able to start farming again, growing vegetables to feed her family, and selling the surplus at the local market in Nyamukubi, which allowed her to begin rebuilding her savings, little by little.</p>



<p>""I am so grateful for the roofing sheets. The aid helped me realise we could rebuild and get on with our lives,” she says.</p>

<p>Venezuela | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Venezuela, Delta Amacuro. </strong>Soila Palacios is a medical doctor, a native Warao from Delta Amacuro in the far east of the country, and a language interpreter. This makes her a critical member of the team at Venezuelan NGO El Paragüero, where she regularly joins the team to translate between the Warao indigenous language and Spanish.</p>



<p>Delta Amacuro was one of three states in 2023 to benefit from the Venezuela Humanitarian Fund’s focus on funding for indigenous communities. Soila knows this area, and these people, well. Some villages take four hours to reach by boat. &nbsp;Soila explains that many people feel comfortable telling her things in Warao that they wouldn’t share in Spanish, or with someone who only spoke Spanish.</p>



<p>Delta Amacuro is a poor region, where 66 per cent of people live in extreme poverty. The economic collapse in Venezuela has resulted in loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, and a lack of basic services. Many of the most vulnerable people are forced to reduce meals or engage in other negative coping activities for survival. </p>



<p>Dr. Palacios supports a project for women funded by the Venezuela Humanitarian Fund and implemented by El Paragüero together with HIAS. The project aims to reach 70 per cent of the women here with protection, livelihoods, and health support.</p>



<p>The protection work includes legal counselling to obtain birth registration; improving systems to prevent trafficking and GBV, and strengthening child protection. Food security interventions include training on fishing, handicrafts, and local food processing: a significant driver of food insecurity is the loss of local fishing knowledge, and other ‘traditional’ activities. Health assistance focuses on training staff, including midwives, and strengthening community-based health surveillance, so that people look out for each other and can refer them to the clinic when needed.</p>



<p>Soila sees her role as more than work. “As a translator, I help empower and support indigenous people here, especially the most vulnerable,” she explains.&nbsp;For example, during training on fishing or food processing, Dr. Palacios is on hand to translate and make sure women’s questions are raised - and answered clearly. Her presence makes the women more comfortable to ask questions, and she helps them get the answers they’re looking for.</p>



<p>With her linguistic expertise and deep understanding of the communities, Dr. Palacios helps ensure the respectful integration of diverse cultures, the full participation of indigenous people in all phases of the project, and successful outcomes for women.</p>

<p><strong>Somalia, Dollow. </strong>El Niño triggered devastating floods in Somalia October to December 2023, intensifying the already major humanitarian needs for people facing severe drought, food insecurity, malnutrition, and disease outbreaks. A complex humanitarian crisis driven by climate change.</p>



<p>The floods displaced over one million people, and extensively damaged crops, farmland, roads and bridges. Over 2.48 million people were affected by the floods.</p>



<p>As the flood waters recede, people are gradually returning to their homes.&nbsp; However, their needs remain high as they navigate the path of recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Safe water sources were destroyed</strong></p>



<p>In Dollow, the floods caused significant destruction, destroying sanitation infrastructure and leading to an increase in illness. In the Kaharey camp for internally displaced persons, people like Qumaan Nur Ali and her family are struggling. ""We had no place to sleep or cook as our tent was filled with water. It has been an incredibly challenging time for me and my children.""</p>



<p>The flood also destroyed the only safe water source for the community, a single well, so they had no choice but to bring contaminated water from the river. Qumaan explained that the river water is dirty, and there are crocodiles there, making it a dangerous trip.</p>



<p><strong>Emergency water trucking</strong></p>



<p>With funding from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF), Somali NGO Nomadic Assistance for Peace and Development (NAPAD) provided clean water for at-risk and El Niño-affected displaced people - and host communities - in Kurdubey and Kaharey IDP camps in Dollow District for three months.</p>



<p>Almost 3,000 people, including Qumaan and her children, can now access clean water from water bladders filled by the water trucks here. These efficiently distribute water to a purpose-built water standpoint with six taps, providing the community with a reliable, safe, and easily accessible clean water source for drinking and other domestic needs.</p>



<p>Thanks to the project, Qumaan and her children have clean water every day. This has significantly reduced illness, especially among children.</p>



<p>The water trucking has been a critical help, but it is not a permanent solution. <em>""</em>NAPAD came to our help when we needed them most. We hope the programme can continue until we get a sustainable source of clean water,’’ Qumaan said.</p>

<p>Afghanistan| 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Afghanistan, Balkh province. </strong>Chemtal district is one of the most remote districts in the country. People depend on their livestock and their crops, but many of the most rural villages lack clean water and sanitation.</p>



<p>Additionally, severe climate change effects have precipitated a widespread water crisis across the country, generating new food, health and nutrition needs. Rising temperatures are rapidly changing rainfall patterns across the country, further diminishing people’s access to safe water.</p>



<p>Despite a significant reduction in active hostilities, Afghanistan remains a protection crisis with high levels of protracted displacement; mines and explosive ordnance; restrictions on freedom of movement; and increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV).</p>



<p>In rural parts of Balkh, access to safe water has long been a challenge. Chatralyan village is one of the poorest here. People rely on water from local lakes and smaller ponds, which are sometimes contaminated, and they have to travel to the lake then carry back the water by hand. By day, men and boys do the job, but after dark, the dangerous task falls to women.</p>



<p>As Najia, a local resident, explained, “Every year many of our kids fall sick and even die because of the water. Our animals are dying too. And we women also face harassment when we go to get water from the pond.”</p>



<p>With funding from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, Afghan NGO Organization for Afghan Women Capacity and Knowledge (OAWCK) repaired a well near Naija’s village, also serving other villages in the remote district. “Every single person here will pray for you,” she said, in thanks for these improvements.</p>



<p>The NGO also conducted GBV awareness sessions for men and women. It was important to start addressing the harassment Naija describes. “Boys and men are committing such violence,” says Fatima, another resident. “I have witnessed such crimes. So I want to share information with my family about why this is harmful.”</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p>Lebanon, Baalbek. Lebanon’s multiple crises have degraded the water system significantly. The water infrastructure is in a state of imminent collapse due to frequent power outages, a shortage of diesel fuel, and extremely high inflation rates.</p>



<p>These have left the public water providers in Lebanon unable to pump enough water to serve their communities.</p>



<p>In Zarifa’s neighbourhood, access to safe water was intermittent. Sometimes, they didn’t have water for up to 10 days, meaning they had to buy fuel themselves to pump it or hire a truck to bring it to different neighbourhoods. In reality, it meant that richer neighborhoods got water, while others were deprived.</p>



<p>Usually, the woman of the house is in charge of rationing and managing the water – leaving many women bearing the brunt of family stress. “We had to make difficult choices,” explains Zarifa. “Cleaning the house one day meant sacrificing washing clothes, or even showering.”</p>



<p>With funding from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, Oxfam built a solar-powered pumping station and a chlorination station. The solar power provides regular electricity to the borehole, allowing water to be pumped regularly.</p>



<p>The solar water station brought some relief. “Now, water is available around the clock, pumped every other day, and meets our needs,” says Zarifa.</p>

<p>Ethiopia| 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Ethiopia, East Hargaghe and Oromia regions</strong>. &nbsp;“We used to spend hours fetching water,” recalls Misriya Teha, who lives in Lemi village in East Hargaghe. A neighbor, Aliya, had to rely on sending her kids to fetch water. “They wasted precious time and missed school,” she says.</p>



<p>After five consecutive failed rainy seasons since late 2020, communities affected by the prolonged drought in southern and southeastern Ethiopia were relieved to see good 2023 belg rains. This brought temporary solace, replenishing water sources in some areas and rejuvenating pasture.</p>



<p>However, continued assistance is critical while recovery continues over the next few years. Water points remain contaminated, and many areas simply lack access to improved water infrastructure.</p>



<p><strong>Emergency provisions for drought-affected people.</strong></p>



<p>In Oromia, sixty-year old Zeyineba Omar Obadi got water from a local pond. But it was not safe water. The years of drought have rendered the pond contaminated. “We are getting water from polluted ponds, polluted by animal waste and dirt. We frequently got sick but we had no other option here,” she said.</p>



<p>With funding from the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, IRC provided a temporary fix for situations like Zeyineba’s, where there is no safe water available: emergency WASH assistance in the form of water treatment chemicals. “Now we have what we need to treat the water. We can use it to drink, wash, and cook. We get sick less often.” Zeyineba hopes such chemicals can remain available.</p>



<p><strong>Investing in water infrastructure.</strong></p>



<p>Poor water infrastructure continues to limit people’s access in many rural areas. For humanitarians, improving water infrastructure for underserved communities is a key priority.</p>



<p>With support from the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, Care International constructed seven solar-powered community water supply schemes in the area, reaching about 45,000 people with clean water.Health facilities in Alola, Chella, Chira, Finte-bas, Biko and Rogge were also connected to the piped water through the solar water schemes.</p>



<p>Access to safe drinking water at a convenient distance from home has become a reality. ""Now, I can fetch water every day without interruption, thanks to the solar-powered system,"" Misriya said.</p>



<p>""We don’t have to worry about fuel costs or generators breaking down. Clean water flows right into our village."" Aliya’s kids aren’t missing school any more. “They can focus on their studies better now,” she said.</p>



<p>Bedriya Abrahim, who lives in Gende Kebira village, also pointed out that, “We were at the mercy of the generators before. Now with the solar-powered systems, it’s much more reliable.”</p>

<p><strong>oPt, West Bank.</strong> The small community of Qila, in Area C of the West Bank, has faced several challenges in recent decades. Displaced from their land for over twenty years, this Bedoiun community currently live about 12km northwest of Hebron.</p>



<p>Like many communities, Qila lacked basic services and access to decent water and sanitation, leading to disease and difficult living conditions. “I was mostly concerned about the children, who were bitten by bugs attracted by the wastewater and then fell ill,” said Abu Waleed, leader of this community of about 60 people.</p>



<p>With funding from the OPT Humanitarian Fund, Action Against Hunger built a sewage network to connect all the houses to a treatment plant in the nearby town of Kharas.</p>



<p>The organization also opened up a new road for the network and helped renovate the street leading to the community and the treatment plant.</p>



<p>At the heart of this transformation stood Abu Waleed. He worked closely with the organization to ensure the success of the project.</p>



<p>""This project has changed our lives,” he said.</p>



<p>His words echoed the sentiments of the entire community, as the new sewage networks improved their living conditions and provided them with a clean and healthy environment to raise their families.</p>



<p>The project also aimed to achieve long-term environmental sustainability. The community are planning to convert sewage sludge into a valuable resource for farming.</p>



<p>This forward-thinking approach has benefited the Qila community and has the potential to positively impact the surrounding areas for the next generation.</p>

As the currency continues to depreciate, essential items like food, medicine, and baby supplies are increasingly unaffordable – let alone the agricultural equipment that George needed to make a living off the land on his own..</p>



<p>An estimated 3.9 million people need some form of humanitarian assistance in Lebanon.</p>



<p>With support from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, Action Against Hunger reached vulnerable families in Baalbek and Rachaya with cash assistance, for them to spend to help themselves.</p>



<p><em>Investing in better farm equipment</em></p>



<p>For George, the money meant he could invest in farming tools and equipment to grow and harvest his olives, almonds, grapes, and pomegranates. And, of course, the new equipment – which includes a trimmer, saw, leaf blower and better fencing - is something he can use every season.</p>



<p>“This help was indispensable. Every person has different needs - I was able to buy the specific things I needed to grow food,” he said.</p>



<p><em>Nutrition and medicine for struggling families</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the province, Jana’s baby Arsal struggles with heart problems. The medical treatment and medication are very expensive, and Jana’s husband is only able to find work as a day labourer. Since the crisis, it’s been very hard to get by.</p>



<p>Action Against Hunger’s project provided struggling families with nutrition, cash assistance, and child development classes.</p>



<p>The cash helped Jana buy medicine and food for her daughter. The classes gave her practical information to help her daughter as well. Jana talked about what she learned with her friends and other mothers too, sharing useful information.</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Tripoli</strong>. Ala’s family escaped war and sought refuge in Tripoli six years ago. She and her siblings attend public school there, and access education services at the retention assistance program, alongside other refugee children and vulnerable Lebanese.</p>



<p>Children’s access to education has been severely affected by the economic crisis. <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/children-hit-ever-harder-lebanons-unrelenting-crises"">In December 2023, more than a quarter of families (26%) had children who are not going to school, up from 18% in April 2023.</a> And for children who might need extra help with their core skills, private tutoring is out of reach.</p>



<p><em>Providing extra help and discovering new interests</em></p>



<p>With funding from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, the Lebanese organizations Al Fayhaa Association and Ana Aqra are running a “retention support” program that gives families and children tools and resources to support them staying in education.</p>



<p>This programme runs alongside traditional schools, and supports the children most at risk of dropping out by addressing learning loss.</p>



<p>Ala, who is in the eighth grade, initially did not write or speak much in class. But at the Dar Al Zahraa education centre, her teacher recognized her talent for drawing and interest in design. With her teacher encouraging her interests, Ala started to enjoy school more.</p>



<p>Mariam, who is in fourth grade and is Lebanese, explains, “I truly enjoy coming to the centre… I can complete my work and feel at ease.” She gets help with her homework from the public school and can get extra help when she doesn’t understand something. Her friend Duaa felt similar, “my teacher’s patience here was important to me.”</p>



<p>Bara’ is in first grade. He was having trouble writing and holding the pen. He did not feel confident and was falling behind his peers. At the education centre, teachers worked closely with him, giving him the time he needed to focus on his writing in a relaxed atmosphere: and he has been able to improve his skills.</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Bekaa valley. </strong>Every summer, the Bekaa Valley faces the tent fire season. These are a significant threat to families who, having fled conflict in Syria, are often sheltering in tents and other informal settlements.</p>



<p>With funding from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, Medair has brought fire safety classes, as well as fire extinguishers, to those at-risk communities.</p>



<p>Nader, the Medair program officer, meets with community leaders and asks them to get families together to join a learning session. “I teach them how to use the fire extinguisher, and also how to regularly check that it’s still functional by checking the pressure,” Nader explains.</p>



<p>Nader also talks about fire safety and how to minimize risk. This includes keeping children away from hazards and arranging the home to keep the cooking fire away from dangerous materials.</p>



<p>The fire extinguishers are distributed to community focal points who are trained in their use. Khadija, a mother and fire safety focal point, explains that, “I feel more secure. With these skills, I know I can protect my family if a fire breaks out.”</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Beirut.</strong> When asked about life in Lebanon these days, Nadine, with wry humour, quips, ""Absolutely lovely."" She goes on to explain, ""The economic situation in Lebanon is tough, and it is evident everywhere. Everyone is in the same boat.""</p>



<p>Nadine, 44, lives with her husband and their three children. Struggling to cope with successive crises, the family has relied on assistance for the past four years, as the income Nadine’s husband was making in his job is no longer enough.</p>



<p>His salary comes in Lebanese pounds – which has suffered 98 per cent deflation since 2019. Meanwhile, the price of food has increased by 300 per cent.</p>



<p>""The situation wasn't like this before. There were challenges, but our income was sufficient. Now, even when there's a job, we're still struggling,” explained Nadine.</p>



<p>“We're living off food donations and have got used to it. We can't afford to buy vegetables. It's quite hard for us to afford tomatoes. Sometimes we get them during the school semester so that my children can go to school with a simple sandwich.”</p>



<p>Nadine's situation mirrors that of many Lebanese families hit hard by the economic crisis and its long-term consequences. According to a recent study by OCHA in Lebanon, an estimated 3.9 million people need some form of humanitarian assistance in Lebanon.</p>



<p>Nadine is visually impaired. ""I can't leave the house frequently. My home is everything to me. I know every corner; I've adapted to being here.""</p>



<p>The issue of housing and rent occupies Nadine's thoughts. As the economic crisis began to worsen, paying the rent became the family’s top concern.</p>



<p>Because of the currency deflation, rent costs jumped overnight. Figures from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) indicate that monthly rent for families like Nadine’s increased more than six-fold, on average from two to thirteen million Lebanese pounds. Compare this to the five million pounds ($55 USD) that average workers earn per month, and it instantly becomes clear why people don’t have enough to cover the basics.</p>



<p>With the support of the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s shelter team offered cash assistance to vulnerable families like Nadine’s. It helped her family to cover rent and other basic expenses, at least for a while.</p>



<p>Nadine says that the assistance provided by NRC helped improve things for six months, but given the situation, it is not enough.</p>



<p>""Six months of rent coverage just isn't enough. Many people still need help. I'm fortunate to have a roof over my head, but others don't. I could be homeless one day.""</p>

<p><strong>oPt, Gaza.</strong>&nbsp; In Dier Elbalah, Mahmoud is sheltering with his children in a tent. He and his wife regularly skip meals. “We eat less so the kids can eat at least one meal a day.”</p>



<p>Six months into the hostilities, and as intense bombardment continues, people in Gaza continue to face hunger, trauma, and unsafe living conditions.</p>



<p>People are hungry.Some <a href=""https://www.wfp.org/stories/hunger-gaza-famine-findings-dark-mark-world-says-wfp-palestine-country-director"">1.1 million Gazans are now experiencing catastrophic hunger</a> – a number that has doubled in three months.</p>



<p>People have lost their homes: 1.7 million people are displaced.</p>



<p>People face a health and sanitation crisis. Across displacement sites, there is an average of one toilet for every 700 people.</p>



<p>In Rafah, Eman and thousands of others wait just to take care of basic needs. “I have to wait two hours to use the bathroom. The line is very long,” she explains. It is particularly difficult for her four children to deal with this.</p>



<p><em>Pooled funds support our partners to save lives</em></p>



<p>The Central Emergency Response Fund responded to the crisis with a US $12 million Rapid Response allocation and a further $6.7 million Underfunded Emergencies allocation, both in October. CERF funding is supporting routine vaccination for children, medical care for pregnant women and babies, protection, food assistance, <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/sop/stories/terrible-living-conditions-displaced-families"">shelter and household basics</a>, and other life-saving activities.</p>



<p>At the same time, Palestinian and international partners of the oPt Humanitarian Fund have been delivering immediate food, shelter, health, water, and other assistance since the fighting began. Since 7 October, the oPt HF has disbursed some $50 million to respond to urgent needs in Gaza, with further allocations planned soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Addressing hunger is a top priority</em></p>



<p>CERF funding helped WFP deliver ready-to-eat food packages for Mahmoud and his children.</p>



<p>The variety was welcome. “When the food parcel came, my mother said she’d change the lunch plans to include green beans, which the kids were craving,” Mahmoud said. Until then, the family had eaten only rice.</p>



<p>This food delivery was enough to last the family fifteen days.</p>



<p>In Rafah, ACTED and their Palestinian partners ‘Unlimited Friends Association for Development’ and Feres Al-Arab used money from the oPt Humanitarian Fund to distribute emergency food – both cooked food and staple supplies - to people sheltering in community centers.</p>



<p>They focused on reaching the most vulnerable people including women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, with the emergency parcels.</p>



<p>Also in Rafah, oPt HF partners Oxfam Novib and PEF worked together to deliver emergency household supplies, including jerry cans for water storage , pillows and bedding; while Première Urgence Internationale (PUI) and the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees (PARC) distributed vegetable baskets, ready-to-eat food, and hygiene packages for displaced people.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Water, sanitation, and shelter</em></p>



<p>With millions of people on the move and living in informal shelters addressing water and sanitation needs – like those Eman described – is critical.</p>



<p>With funding from CERF and other donors, UNICEF is providing emergency water trucking and mobile latrines in the worst affected areas.</p>



<p>Our partners are also helping keep overcrowded living spaces clean. In Khan Younis, oPt HF partner ‘WeWorld’ organized community cleaning campaigns – including trash collection and disposal – in under-served displacement sites, to help create a safer environment.</p>

<p><strong>Chad, Farchana camp.</strong> Before war broke out, Malaaz lived in El Geneina. “I could eat whenever I wanted, and I could eat the food I like. I can’t do that here,” she explains.</p>



<p>Since war broke out in April 2023, 8.1 million people have been displaced from their homes. Their lives disrupted, children like Malaaz are traumatized, whether they have crossed an international border or are internally displaced.</p>



<p><em>Child-friendly spaces in Chad</em></p>



<p>About half a million people fled to Chad – among them, Malaaz and her family.</p>



<p>When hostilities broke out, CERF supported UN agencies in providing life-saving humanitarian action in Sudan and the neighbouring countries. This included a US $14 million allocation to Chad to help Sudanese refugees.</p>



<p>In Farchana camp, Malaaz stays with her grandmother and aunt. Here, she and her friends have access to a child-friendly space that UNICEF established with CERF funding.</p>



<p>“We have games in this place,” she says. “Every morning from 8 to 11 we come here.” The space is open to different age groups at different times in the day. “We can model with clay, and we draw,” explains Malaaz.</p>



<p>The children play sports, too. “We play volleyball and soccer,” says Malaaz. “I’m a great volleyball player – better than the UNICEF man who is in charge of the space. Every time he comes, he plays with us. But he is not that good a player,” she laughs.</p>



<p>The child-friendly space is a reprieve and critical for children’s mental health following the traumatic events they experienced. Here, children can also access specialist psychological support if they need it, and there are activities for teenagers and parents.</p>



<p><em>Child counselling in Blue Nile</em></p>



<p>Within Sudan, schools remain closed, and many children are on the move, displaced from home and traumatized. Pooled funds are also helping children access psychosocial support.</p>



<p>For example, in Blue Nile, the Sudan Humanitarian Fund enabled NGO LM International to provide displaced children affected by the violence with water and sanitation assistance, education, psychosocial support and counselling, as well as group activities.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, El Fasher, Port Sudan and elsewhere. </strong>In El Fasher, Omnya, aged 12, attended an activity session for kids to learn about safe water and sanitation. She learned valuable information, but the trauma of the war was never far from her mind.</p>



<p>She and her family are taking shelter in a school here, alongside 700 other people. &nbsp;“I want the fighting to stop, I want to play,” she said.</p>



<p><a href=""https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan"">Since war broke out in April 2023, 8.1 million people have been displaced inside and outside Sudan</a>, and nearly 25 million people – more than half of them children- need humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p>As people shelter in schools and transit stations, drinking water and sanitation facilities become overwhelmed, posing a health risk for children and their families. Suspected cholera cases continue to rise, surpassing 10,000 in February 2024.</p>



<p>OCHA’s pooled funds are helping humanitarians to respond.</p>



<p>With the help of CERF and other donors, UNICEF has provided thousands of displaced people in El Fasher with access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, including families like Omnya’s.</p>



<p><em>Emergency water and hygiene services at stations and border crossings</em></p>



<p>At the Suk Shabi bus station in Kassala, displaced people from all over Sudan gather as they try to move on. Many must wait at the bus station for days or weeks as they plan their next moves. Hygiene rapidly deteriorates and there’s an urgent need for better sanitation and clean water.</p>



<p>Here, with funding from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, LM International <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LMInternationalSudan/posts/397160692833196"">constructed a new block of latrines </a>to serve the waiting travellers.</p>



<p><a href=""https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan"">Over 450,000 people have fled – or are trying to flee – to Egypt</a>, overwhelming the basic services provided at border crossings. Rural bus stations were just not ready to host hundreds of fleeing families.</p>



<p>With funding from CERF, UNICEF partnered with Aswan Water Company to provide clean water, sanitation, and hygiene support, by deploying water trucks to the Argeen and Qustul border crossings as well as the Karkar international bus station.</p>



<p>At the same time, UNICEF provided proper waste disposal from the septic tanks, distributed essential supplies like soap and sanitizer, and built new toilet facilities at critical transport hubs to reduce the risk of disease and preserve people’s dignity despite the extremely difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Sudan | 2023 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Sudan, Kosti. </strong>Lubna still remembers the sound of shelling in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital city, in March 2023. The 34-year-old mother was pregnant at the time. “I was wondering how I can guarantee the safety of my unborn child, my other children and myself,” she recalled in October. “Who will give me a helping hand in these terrible circumstances? I did not know what to do.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lubna and her family were among the millions who fled Khartoum following the outbreak of violence in April 2023. Since then over 8.1 million people have been displaced inside and outside Sudan; and nearly 25 million people – more than half of them children - need humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p><strong>Immediate medical help</strong></p>



<p>As soon as fighting began, using funding from CERF and other sources, UNFPA &nbsp;deployed mobile clinics to displacement sites across the country to reach women and girls with prenatal care, STI testing and treatment, and other obstetrical health care.</p>



<p>The clinics are staffed by a doctor, laboratory technician, midwives, and a pharmacist, and are sent to areas where people moved to across the country.</p>



<p>While humanitarian needs were growing, medical supplies were limited, and protection risks on the rise. And, for thousands of pregnant women like Lubna, the situation was even more difficult.</p>



<p>In June 2023, Lubna and her family scraped together the money they needed to flee Khartoum. At seven months pregnant, she made the arduous 15-hour journey by bus to Kosti, in White Nile State, taking refuge in a school at the Ezzedine displacement site.</p>



<p>Living with her children in this temporary refuge has been challenging, but one thing Lubna did not have to worry about was reproductive health care. Immediately on arrival, Lubna received medical attention at a UNFPA-supported mobile clinic, including an examination, medication, and psychosocial support. Thereafter, she was able to receive routine care.</p>



<p>""Lubna had frequent pregnancy checks at the clinic,” said Aisha, a midwife at the mobile clinic. Lubna also received a clean delivery kit, containing sterile supplies to facilitate a safe birth. The kits are given out in case women end up delivering at home or in a poorly equipped facility.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Lubna was able to deliver at the clinic: on 12 September, Lubna gave birth to a healthy baby girl.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, Gedaref. </strong>Three women displaced from Omdurman, in Sudan's Khartoum State, waited in a room at Gedaref City Municipality, where the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) had set up a cash assistance point.</p>



<p>The women showed their IDs, signed the required forms, and received 177,100 Sudanese pounds (US$275), provided by NRC, thanks to funding from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>The funds offer some relief in these difficult times. One woman explained, ""I will buy cooking pots, plates, cups and some mats for my family with this money."" &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href=""https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan"">Since war broke out in April 2023, 8.1 million people have been displaced inside and outside Sudan</a>, and nearly 25 million people – more than half of them children - need humanitarian assistance. And with 17.7 million people facing acute hunger, the upcoming harvest is expected to be critically reduced, driving even higher food prices.</p>



<p>Some families are displaced multiple times – and their needs are great.</p>



<p>In Gedaref, NRC decided to use cash to help people with basic household items and shelter because it is more effective, faster, and easier to control. Distributing in-kind supplies would require importing those items from overseas, as the conflict has disrupted Sudan's production and supply chains.</p>



<p>Phyllis Wanja, an Area Support Manager in eastern Sudan, said that NRC advocates for cash assistance for shelter and basic items, but also for other needs. ""With cash assistance, the people we are aiming to support, especially with multi-purpose cash, can get what they actually need, based on their priorities,"" she said.</p>



<p>One of the women said that she needed to fix the roof of her family’s shelter, and this money would help. ""We are a large family: my father, mother, brother and sisters, and their children”, she added. “We will create more space by putting up poles and covering them with plastic sheets to protect us from the sun.""</p>

<p>Sudan | 2023 | CERF and CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Sudan.</strong> The conflict in Sudan has upended the lives of millions of people. Amid a catastrophic economic crisis, market disruptions and critical shortages, national agricultural production is expected to drop. This translates into rising hunger and eroded incomes.</p>



<p>Yet, some small farmers are managing to keep working on their land. Their contribution to Sudan’s food security has never been more important.</p>



<p>Between July and September 2023, 20.3 million people – 42 per cent of the population – were facing crisis levels of acute food insecurity. Food insecurity was worst in states with active conflict, including Khartoum, South and West Kordofan, and East, West, Central and South Darfur.</p>



<p>In response, FAO – with support from CERF, the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, and other donors – delivered 10,000 tonnes of seeds to one million vulnerable farming households – reaching some five million people across Sudan just in time for planting season. This critical assistance should meet the cereal needs of up to 19 million people for a year, supporting local production and sustaining livelihoods.</p>



<p>“The need for swift agricultural support in Sudan is paramount. While much work lies ahead, we are fully committed to leveraging this crucial planting season's window of opportunity and our efforts on the ground continue daily,"" said Hongjie Yang, then FAO Representative in Sudan. ""Our goal is to navigate the complex security and logistical challenges to continue to reach farmers in the country with this time-sensitive assistance.""&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, Kassala. </strong>Like many families, Nahid and her children fled the fighting and are now sheltering in a school, along with hundreds of other people.</p>



<p>“Three of my five kids became very sick after the long and hard journey fleeing the fighting in Aj Jazirah. When we arrived here in this school in Kassala, they were coughing badly and had a high fever. I had no money to take them to the doctor and I did not know what to do,” said Nahid, a 35-year-old mother.</p>



<p>Another woman sheltering at the same school advised her to take the children to a nearby clinic, supported by CARE International.</p>



<p>“At the clinic in Halanaga neighbourhood, a doctor examined my kids and advised me to do some tests. My children were given medication after that and I am grateful that it was all free,” explained Nahid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The clinic here is receiving new medical equipment, drugs and supplies as part of a Care International project funded by the Sudan Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>They are providing displaced people and host communities with life-saving health services – including nutrition, immunization, and family planning - through four health facilities, two each in Kassala and New Halfa.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>“The new wave of displacement into Kassala from Gezira state has put an additional burden on the already overstretched health services here, and the number of patients we serve at the CARE Sudan-supported health clinics has doubled. The humanitarian needs are unprecedented, and we urgently need more resources to expand our services and reach more people,” Ahmed, who works with CARE, explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Osman, a 65-year-old man from Aj Jazirah pointed out that the facility is clean and he was pleased with the health services he had been offered. “I have been diabetic for years and while travelling along the unpaved road to Kassala I felt very unwell. I was not able to visit the doctor as I had no money. But when I arrived in Kassala, my brother took me to this clinic in Halanaga and was treated for free,” he said.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan, Blue Nile. </strong>Noureldin contracted polio when he was younger. His father, Elnour, explained, ""We didn’t know much about his condition, and we were also struggling economically, so we weren’t able to properly attend to it. Unfortunately, as a result, Noureldin is living with a physical disability.""&nbsp;</p>



<p>Noureldin cannot walk and can use only one arm. ""When I was younger, my mother used to help me. But now that I’m grown up, she is not able to do that anymore.""</p>



<p>Elnour, Noureldin, and the rest of their family had to flee fighting in Khartoum and went to try to find safety in Ed Damazine, the capital of Blue Nile. Like many vulnerable displaced people across Sudan, Elnour is struggling to provide for his family. He is a daily-wage earner, so he couldn’t afford to buy Noureldin a wheelchair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>""I would barely leave the house,” says Noureldin. “It was too difficult to crawl on the rocky and muddy ground, and I preferred to stay at home. One day I fell and hurt my ear and the left side of my face,"" he adds, showing the scar on his face and head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Sudan Humanitarian Fund-supported project, implemented with Save the Children, AlSalam Organization for Rehabilitation, and the Child Development Fund aims to reach children with disability who have been affected by the fighting.</p>



<p>As part of the project, a Community-Based Child Protection Network is reaching out to support families with children living with disability.</p>



<p>“[One of our community leaders] came to our house to ask after Noureldin,” says Elnour. After that, they received a wheelchair for Noureldin, as well as some food and household items to help the rest of the family.</p>



<p>""It changed everything for me and my family. Now I can finally go outside and enjoy time with my friends,” he said, adding that he goes to the nearby child-friendly space supported by Save the Children and plays with his peers.</p>



<p>""I come here with my brothers, and we play with other children. It’s great!” Noureldin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Elnour hopes that his family will not be displaced again: “Millions of people are currently fleeing from conflict in Khartoum, Darfur, and other states. Until now, our area has been relatively safe. We pray every day that it remains calm and that the rest of Sudan can return to peace.”</p>

<p><strong>Central African Republic, Bria. </strong>The Central African Republic has experienced over a decade of political and humanitarian crisis, driving displacements both inside and outside the country. For many affected people, however,&nbsp; &nbsp;it is finally time to return home.</p>



<p>In two neighborhoods in Bria, with funding from the OCHA-managed CAR Humanitarian Fund, OXFAM-Intermón built two solar water pumping systems which will help about 6,000 people– mostly returnees from the conflict – to access safe water.</p>



<p>Arnold is a father of six, but only his youngest baby daughter who was able to take her first steps in their home, after years of displacement. In 2020, Arnold’s family was one of the first to return to Yafara neighborhood in Bria city, after spending four years in the Bria ‘PK3’ internal displacement site.</p>



<p>Although the conflict had destroyed a lot of their neighbourhood, Arnold and his family still wanted to come back. They had to rely on water from the nearest river, though, and suffered from water-borne diseases. “It seemed as though I was spending one day at home and then a week at the hospital,” he said of recurring illnesses he, his wife, and the children went through.</p>



<p>Thanks to the solar water pump Arnold knows that he and the children now have access to safe water.</p>



<p>The community manages the installation and operations themselves. They are able to sell any excess water, which means they can fund system maintenance and keep it sustainable into the future.</p>

<p><strong>CAR, Ouham-Pende. </strong>Like many communities in the Ouham-Pende region of the Central African Republic, the villages of Bikanga, Bossanbina and Sangrélim have faced years of armed conflict, which has driven displacement, disrupted social structures, and left families struggling to get enough food.</p>



<p>One in five Central Africans is either internally displaced or has fled abroad due to the ongoing violence. Children are particularly at risk and need additional protection.</p>



<p><em>Child protection and psychosocial support</em></p>



<p>In Bakouma, with funding from the CAR Humanitarian Fund, local organization Esperance has been addressing urgent child protection needs. They help children and young people who have left armed groups or survived other forms of violence to access mental health counselling and practical livelihoods training.</p>



<p>Similarly, in Bikanga and neighboring villages, national women-led organization, AFPE, with funding from the OCHA-managed CAR Humanitarian Fund, invested in improving community-based protection services, including for example, safe spaces for women, child protection committees, and community watch groups to identify and resolve protection issues.</p>



<p>A key focus has been on children who were previously associated with armed groups and are now trying to return to normal life. Fifty children joined classes teaching them vocational and business skills, based on their interests and what the community needs. “I’m happy with what I’m learning now, I think it will help me in the future,” said Noel*, a young participant.</p>



<p>Another young woman built up a soap-making business, selling to neighbours so that she could support herself and her children.</p>



<p>Overall, some 13,000 children and young people in the area benefitted from these child protection services. For young people and children who have lived through extreme circumstances, it is a small step toward normalcy and recovery - and hope.</p>

<p><strong>Rafai, Haut-Mbomou,</strong> <strong>Central African Republic. </strong>Amid the Central African Republic’s humanitarian crisis, over 120 national NGOs were engaged in trying to help affected people.  </p>



<p>However, insufficient funding opportunities and institutional capacities limited what they were able to deliver.</p>



<p> An example of this was observed in the southwestern town of Rafai, where thousands of people displaced from Zemio, Guinikoumba, Dembia, Guerekindo, Kpiamou and Mangoupa all lacked access to clean water and sanitation and existing services were overwhelmed.</p>



<p>APSUD, a national NGO, developed a transformative project with the aim to enhance the capacity of three national NGOs — Organization of Women for Humanitarian Action and Sustainable Recovery (OFAHRD), Let’s Stand Up for Sustainable Development Promotion (LNPDD), and AU SECOURS (Aid Association). Funded by the CAR Humanitarian Fund, this collaboration focused on providing financial support and project management skills to empower the local organizations and help them respond more effectively to the growing humanitarian needs in Rafai.</p>



<p>""I have regular coaching sessions three times a week on monitoring and evaluation”, says Mexant, LNPDD’s Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, of the APSUD capacity-building program. “Before this training, our tools were haphazardly gathered from various sources. It was initially quite a challenge for us to work within APSUD's operational environment, but, as we attended more and more sessions, we realized the importance of reassessing our methodology. &nbsp;And then we upgraded all our monitoring and evaluation systems.”</p>



<p>Capacity-building projects like this have helped instill newfound confidence in project implementation in Rafai – and improved the humanitarian services that people are getting.</p>

<p>Afghanistan | 2023 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Afghanistan, Badakhshan province.</strong> Sharif, a 68-year-old farmer in Lowani village, says the last few years have been particularly difficult. Climate change has led to an increase in drought and floods, making it hard to keep the farm going. He supports his family of ten on just half a hectare of land, with the hope of growing enough to eat and sell.</p>



<p>Of the 80 million people facing acute food insecurity in Afghanistan, about 80 per cent live in rural areas.</p>



<p>In response to the very fragile food security and nutrition situation, CERF allocated $18 million from its Rapid Response window to support food security and nutrition response. The allocation focused on rural areas that were expected to face severe food insecurity – meaning IPC level 4 or above.</p>



<p>From the $18 million allocation, FAO received $7 million to provide people in the worst-affected areas with improved ‘higher yield’ seeds and fertilizer, animal feed, and livestock better suited to the harsh climate.</p>



<p>Sharif has been able to get improved varieties of wheat, as well as special fertilizer. This wheat is more resistant than other varieties to Badakhshan’s harsh climate – which has worsened due to climate change. Sharif also joined a training course on how to grow the new wheat. He is now growing enough for his family to make bread, with plenty left over to sell. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The FAO programme also improved water irrigation systems in rural areas, including repairs to an important canal that had been damaged. The project employed local builders, which also supported the local economy.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine, Kozylivka village. </strong>Olha and her children fled eastern Ukraine last year. Intense fighting had devastated residential areas and many civilians died.</p>



<p>Olha found a new home and refuge in the village of Kozylivka, Chernihiv Region, in the north of the country. &nbsp;She saw an online advertisement from a family willing to donate their homes to displaced people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recalling the state of their new home, Olha describes it as dismal: ""The building had been uninhabited for some time and was in poor condition. The old wooden window frames were cracked, letting in the wind and rain. I worried that we wouldn't be able to keep the house warm during the cold months.""&nbsp;</p>



<p>The family received winter assistance, including firewood and other supplies, through OCHA's implementing partner agency ZOA, funded by the <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-2023-allocations-dashboard-january-december-2023-enuk"" data-type=""link"" data-id=""https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-2023-allocations-dashboard-january-december-2023-enuk"">Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, </a>as part of a winter response project. </p>



<p>Ukraine’s very cold winter – which lasts from about October until March – adds new vulnerability in a country where 14.6 million people need humanitarian assistance. “Freezing winter months are already extremely challenging for people to survive, let alone when their homes and critical civilian infrastructure constantly come under fire,” explains Sarah Hilding der Weduwen, Head of OCHA Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 110 aid organizations developed a joint Winter Response Plan to alleviate people’s hardship and support the government’s response. The aid focused on front-line areas as well as those hosting many displaced people, notably around Dnipro, Donetsk, and Kharkiv.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months since the plan was launched, it has helped more than two million Ukrainians, including Olha and her children.</p>

<p>DRC | 2023 | CBPF </p>



<p>DRC, North Kivu. Kahindu lives in a small village. She and her family fled here to escape violence back in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the conflict in DRC was getting even worse, displacing nearly 6.4 million people primarily from the eastern provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu. It is one of the highest displacement crises globally (figures as of August 2023). </p>



<p>Despite its vast agricultural potential, a staggering 25.4 million people in the DRC - or one in every four Congolese - are severely food insecure. </p>



<p>When she fled her home, Kahindu was in the early stages of her pregnancy, and she thought she was expecting twins. But, in February last year, she gave birth to <em>three</em> babies: Pierre, Pierrette, and Ursule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kahindu and her husband survived on small earnings from informal agricultural work. But violence meant they were unable to return to their home. By the time the triplets were seven months old, Kahindu was worried about baby Ursule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ursule was not developing like the other two. She had difficulty feeding, and she didn’t seem to be gaining weight; I found her different from her siblings.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>During a home visit conducted as part of malnutrition screening activities, Rachel,&nbsp;a&nbsp;community health worker trained by Congolese&nbsp;NGO Action of the Future (AOF), with support from the DRC Humanitarian Fund, spoke with Kahindu, and agreed that Ursule was showing signs of malnutrition. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was going door-to-door, and that’s how I came to Kahindu’s house to do the screening. I quickly recommended that the mother take Ursule to the health centre for care.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Oicha health facility provides free care for nutritional emergency cases &nbsp;with the support of AOF’s Emergency Nutrition Response project. This helps displaced people, returnees, and host families in five of Oicha’s health districts in North Kivu. It is funded by the DRC Humanitarian Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After about two months of treatment and follow-up, Ursule regained her health. “Thanks to the healthcare, she is alive and well today. She has even started walking,” said her mother, Kahindu.</p>

<p>Ethiopia | 2023 | CBPF </p>



<p><strong><u>Ethiopia, Dollo Ado region.</u></strong> Iadan, 55, is a mother of seven who lives in the town of Dollo Ado in the Somali region, sharing a small house with her husband and seven children.</p>



<p>“We rely on my husband’s income as a day labourer. Some days we have enough, and others we struggle to make ends meet.”</p>



<p>Iadan’s family is one of the thousands who were affected by the recent flooding in Dollo Ado. Iadan and her family had to move to a nearby school when floodwaters engulfed their home.</p>



<p>The El Niño-induced floods during the Deyr/Hageya (October-December) rainy season affected approximately 1.5 million people in the south and southeastern parts of Ethiopia, including the Somali, South Ethiopia, Southwest Ethiopia, and Oromia regions.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>“During the flood, I kept all my children safe. We weathered the flood together,” explains Iadan.</p>



<p>The family stayed there in the school for two months until the waters subsided.</p>



<p>The first days in the shelter were incredibly challenging. “We didn’t have anything with us, but, eventually, help arrived.” With Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund support, Save the Children distributed kits with household essentials like mattresses, blankets, and cooking materials. “These supplies helped us,” says Iadan.</p>



<p>As the family returned home, they faced more challenges: the waters had destroyed most of the house. “Day by day, we rely on whatever daily work we can find,” says Iadan. “But we have turned the flood into an opportunity by planting maize in our garden – we hope it’s a step towards more income.”</p>

<p>Myanmar | 2023 | CBPF </p>



<p><strong>Myanmar, Rakhine.&nbsp;</strong> With markets and livelihoods destroyed after Cyclone Mocha, people urgently needed help with sanitation, clean water and ways to make a living.</p>



<p>Cyclone Mocha hit Myanmar’s Rakhine state on 14 May 2023. One of the strongest cyclones ever recorded, Mocha pummeled the coast with sustained winds of 250 km/h and gusts of up to 305 km/h.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cyclone affected more than&nbsp;three million people in Myanmar and heavily damaged latrines, wells, and other water and sanitation infrastructure in displacement camps and sites across Rakhine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A project funded by the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund supported local livelihoods by purchasing equipment and supplies, and hiring local tradespeople to restore water and sanitation infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cash came at a critical time. “After Mocha, we had very few job opportunities and no income coming in,” says a carpenter who worked on the construction. “With the money I earned, we were able to buy food and make some repairs to our home.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>These facilities are essential for people’s health and well-being.&nbsp; The MHF-funded programme used an innovative model to allocate cash and rebuild affected communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than dictate which repairs happened where, the programme created local grant committees. These local committees were made up of affected people, who together decided how best to allocate the funding for the most critical infrastructure repairs in their community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committees managed local work teams that carried out the reconstruction and rehabilitation of latrines and shower stations. The INGO partner provided training and technical support to the committees during the construction process, as well as assisting with the procurement of equipment and supplies, and supporting financial management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Directly engaging the community in allocating the funds fostered a stronger sense of local leadership and ownership over the entire process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With everyone working together, construction finished ahead of schedule, quickly re-establishing access to safe WASH infrastructure. “We felt a great sense of unity in our community by working together to reconstruct the latrines after Cyclone Mocha,” explains a man who was part of the grant committee. “Almost all of our latrines were damaged or destroyed. Working with [the NGO] we were able to repair them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The committee model worked well. “We benefited from the experience of managing the construction process. We learned how to liaise with traders and suppliers. And we learned what it costs to build a latrine, so now we want to maintain them for the longer term.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Yemen | 2023 | CBPF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yemen, Al Makha.</strong> When Nerfan* was four, she was diagnosed with a specific type of cerebral palsy that affects her whole body. Her mother took her to Ta’iz to seek treatment and therapy, but the high costs were not manageable for her family.</p>



<p>After nine years of conflict, sustained economic deterioration and diminished public services, dire levels of humanitarian need continue across Yemen. Over 18.2 million people, or around 53 per cent of the population, are estimated to need humanitarian assistance.</p>



<p>Back home in Al Makha, Nerfan’s mother heard about a programme run by the Humanity and Inclusion (HI) organization. With funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, the aim was to reach children like Nerfan with the specialized services they need.</p>



<p>Mohammed, a physiotherapist with the program, met Nerfan once a week. Working with a ‘baby walker Nerfan was able to learn to walk on her own, with only minimal support.</p>



<p>HI also provided Nerfan and her mother with a full package of services, including psycho-social sessions, as well as the physiotherapy.</p>



<p>Nerfan’s mother was grateful to see her child making progress. “Before, these services weren’t available here.”</p>



<p>Remarkably, Nerfan’s achievements did not stop there. With each session, her ability to stand and walk improved, and Mohammad was optimistic about her continued progress. The transformation was not only physical. Nerfan’s newfound ability to move and walk with balance made her more confident, independent and eager to explore.</p>

<p>Syria | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p>Syria, Alteh village. Fatema, in her fifties, has supported her seven children on her own since her husband’s death.</p>



<p>Displaced from their agricultural land, her family were in a difficult position. For the family to survive, some of the children dropped out of school to work as casual labourers on other people’s farms.</p>



<p>Conflict and economic crisis continue to drive needs in Syria. At least 12.9 million people across the country need food assistance. By October 2023, the cost of the food basket had doubled compared to January - and had quadrupled in two years.</p>



<p>Local organization MASARATT, with funding from the Syria Cross-Border Humanitarian Fund, has been promoting vegetable farming as a new economic opportunity for vulnerable families like Fatema’s. Through the programme, Fatema has accessed seeds, fertilizers, and farming equipment, as well as training and advice on new techniques.</p>



<p>Learning a new-to-her planting technique &nbsp;planting the vegetables in plastic tunnels – Fatema can collect her harvest earlier. This fetches a higher price at the market and provides Fatema’s community with locally grown food that is cheaper than imports.</p>



<p>The extra money she made allowed Fatema to pay off some urgent debts and buy medicines for her kids. If all goes well, she is planning now to send the children back to school during the new school year.</p>

<p>Afghanistan | 2023 | CBPF</p>



<p>Afghanistan, Nangarhar province. The village of Loy Ragha is split in two. One community lives higher up the hillside, and the other down the valley. They have lived peacefully for decades, sharing a water system that relies on solar power. But recently, water has grown more scarce.</p>



<p>""We have faced difficult times with water scarcity,"" said Sabit Khan, a community member. ""Getting water for our basic needs became a daily battle,” he says, and a source of tension.</p>



<p>It was not always this way.</p>



<p>Across Afghanistan, severe climate change is driving a widespread water crisis that leaves no corner of the country untouched, driving food, health and nutrition needs. Providing safe water is a key priority for the Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan in 2024.</p>



<p>Indeed, in Loy Ragha, the climactic shocks combined with a lack of maintenance and intermittent power supply in recent years led to worsening water shortages. These, in turn, drove near-daily disputes over water allocation. The tensions were slowly disrupting the peaceful life the village had for so long enjoyed.</p>



<p>Women spent extra time fetching water from further afield – or their children skipped school to help carry the water. Maihan, a water point clerk, explained, ""Fetching water became a heavy burden for people, stealing precious time from their jobs and education.""&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help resolve the issue the International Organization for Migration (IOM) with funding from the <strong>Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund</strong> (AHF), rehabilitated the water network by repairing and installing new solar panels, and rebuilding tap stands and pipes. This work brought the water system back to life, delivering clean and sustainable water access for more than 100 families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also brought the village together for training on water conservation and water system management, fostering a culture of sustainability and working together.</p>



<p>""The days of water scarcity and conflict are behind us. Now, we are blessed with abundance and resolution,"" said Sabit Khan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>West Bank, Al-Mirkez village. Mohammad was tending his sheep in January 2022 when his life turned upside down. Some of the animals were straying – but as he ran after them to guide them back, he tripped and slipped on an unexploded mine.</p>



<p>He doesn’t remember anything after that. Over a week later, he woke up in the hospital in extreme pain. His hand was missing. Recovery was difficult, and he became depressed. As he tells it, “I didn’t only lose a hand, but also my will to return to normal life, my interest to do anything at all.”</p>



<p>Al Mirkez is in Area C, the largest section of the West Bank. People in the area face a high risk of injury due to unexploded ordnance.</p>



<p>Determined to stay on their family land, Mohammad, his wife and small child, and his parents lived in a natural cave on their land, modifying it to make a simple home. Many neighbouring families have taken a similar decision, so that they can continue a way of life many families have led for generations. Without modern facilities, they live there and look after their animals.</p>



<p>With the support of the <strong>oPt Humanitarian Fund</strong>, Palestinian organization Ma’an and International NGO Action Against Hunger worked to help community members rehabilitate the Caves of Maasafer Yatta to make their shelters more comfortable.</p>



<p>The communities were living under the threat of imminent forcible transfer. This cash project was a last resort - and a temporary shelter solution – but an opportunity for the people to stay on their land, as they preferred, and live with dignity.</p>



<p>Some 72 caves in nine communities were rehabilitated. People received cash to invest in repairs and household supplies. Households were also able to access information on their rights and on the potential risks of cave rehabilitation.</p>



<p>Mohammed opted to use the funds to rehabilitate a cave that he had been using for his animals into a small family dwelling. He used the money to make a cozy and safe home for himself, his wife, and their young son – near his parents, but no longer all having to share a small space.</p>



<p>For Mohammed, the new home means more than shelter: it marks a transition for him from the dark days of recovery from his injury and a new start for himself and his young family.</p>

<p><strong>South Sudan, Fangak County. </strong>Dak Biliu lives in Kuerkan village, South Sudan, where, like most of the population, people are dealing with a complex humanitarian crisis driven by escalating violence, economic instability, climactic shocks, and poor quality basic services.</p>



<p>One significant impact of the situation is acute food insecurity. Over half the population - around 7.1 million people - are expected to face crisis-level or severe acute food insecurity, especially during the April to July lean season.</p>



<p>With funding from the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund, local NGO Community Action Organization reached 25,000 vulnerable people with a capacity-building programme aimed at improving agricultural practices.</p>



<p><br>Dak was one of the participants. He had long wished to stop relying on rations for his family. The programme trained him to teach others about improved planting, vegetable management, and irrigation in the dry season. </p>



<p>He established a plot where he grows vegetables and teaches other farmers what he learned in the programme.</p>



<p>Now, he is earning enough from selling vegetables and teaching that he can invest in a cow. It is a big relief for himself and his family.</p>



<p>“I no longer live like a beggar. I can now afford the basics for my family, such as food, school fees and uniforms, and medical expenses in case anyone falls sick,” he said.</p>

<p><strong>Mongolia | 2024 | CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mongolia. </strong>Mongolia experienced one of its harshest winters in fifty years over 2023-2024. The dzud disaster, coupled with severe animal disease outbreaks, posed a grave threat to the many thousands of people here who depend on their animals to survive and for income.</p>



<p>Although herders tried their best to prepare for hardships in winter, many weren't able to save hay and fodder for their livestock due to drought in the summer, which caused pasture degradation and higher prices.</p>



<p>Many herders suffered heavy losses.</p>



<p>By the end of March 2024, an estimated 10 per cent of the national herd - 6.6 million animals -had died because of the extreme cold. But for individual families, it was often much worse.</p>



<p>For instance, Mr. Kh.Tumurbaatar, a herder from the village of Doit in Ugiinuur sub-district lost around a quarter of his 200 animals. Mr. Myagmar, who owned more than 1,000 animals – reported that by midwinter, about 70 per cent of his animals had died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revised Mongolia Dzud Response Plan, launched on 25 March 2024, identified 76,700 people as the most vulnerable, mostly herders like Mssrs Tumurbaatar and Myagbar who depend entirely on livestock for their livelihoods.</p>



<p>CERF funding is helping the most vulnerable people get enough food for themselves and their livestock, as well as support with nutrition, education and protection.</p>

<p><strong>Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia | 2023 | CERF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. </strong>In early 2023, the Horn of Africa faced the lasting effects of a historic drought, following an unprecedented five consecutive poor rainy seasons.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Some 31.9 million people needed assistance across Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya.</p>



<p>Among them were Temira, Darmi, and Rasuliyan.</p>



<p>Temira took her young daughter Zahara to a mobile health clinic near her home in Chifra, Afar, in north-eastern Ethiopia, for vaccinations and a check-up. The drought in the area was driving malnutrition and disease, and she was worried about her daughter. <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/what-we-do/allocation/2024/summary/23-UF-ETH-58632"">At the time, 11 million people faced severe food insecurity.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, in Kenya, Darmi and her family of eight found themselves struggling to survive after the prolonged drought killed most of their animals, leaving them with only four goats.</p>



<p>While in Somalia, Rasuliyan and her two young children managed to survive drought and major flash floods – only to face dangerous malnutrition.</p>



<p>These are some of the many lives affected by climate change in the region.</p>



<p>CERF was on the frontlines of emergency response to climate-related needs in 2023, helping Temira, Darmi, Rasuylan and others to get through the worst.</p>



<p><em>Health care in drought-affected Ethiopia.</em></p>



<p>Mobile health and nutrition teams were able to reach some of the most remote areas, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and funding from CERF, the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, and USAID.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.afro.who.int/photo-story/delivering-health-services-ethiopias-drought-affected-populations"">Together, they saved lives.</a><br><br>When Temira took her child to the mobile clinic, she was able to get Zahara checked and assessed for malnutrition.</p>



<p>Every week, as part of their outreach efforts, Doctor Ahmed and his colleagues checked between 100 and 120 children. “Most of the children we treat here come with malnutrition, diarrhoea or malaria,” he says.<br><br>Zahara was healthy, and Temira was happy that she did not have to travel far to seek health services. ""This clinic is located near my home, so I can easily bring Zahara here,"" she says. ""And when I am not feeling well, I also get health services here.""</p>



<p><em>Cash assistance in Kenya helps a family rebuild</em></p>



<p>Darmi described life before the drought, a time of abundance when the family owned 115 cattle and 50 goats.</p>



<p>By last June, the drought situation was dire. <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/what-we-do/allocation/2024/summary/23-UF-KEN-59685"">Some 4.4 million people needed assistance</a>. CERF funding supported cash assistance, health care, and other emergency activities for the most vulnerable people.</p>



<p>By that time, Darmi had only four goats left. The animals served not only as a source of wealth but also as a way to meet the family's basic needs. After these devastating losses, they struggled to survive.</p>



<p>In Darmi’s village, a multi-purpose cash assistance programme, <a href=""https://kenya.iom.int/stories/multi-purpose-cash-assistance-program-supporting-women-marsabit-county-mitigate-drought-impact"">funded by United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), worked with IOM and Kenyan organization Strategies for Northern Development.</a></p>



<p>They offered a much-needed lifeline for families like Darmi’s. Darmi received 9,064 Kenyan shillings (approximately USD 68), which made a difference.</p>



<p>""Before the cash, we could barely afford food, but now I can comfortably say my children are getting two solid meals a day,"" she explained.</p>



<p>“I will use some of the cash to buy and raise some chickens,” she added, hoping to sell eggs and meat to support the family further through the difficult time.</p>



<p><em>Emergency response to flood-and-drought driven malnutrition in Somalia</em></p>



<p><em>In Somalia, major floods in November 2023</em> damaged infrastructure and affected the livelihoods and health of over 1.17&nbsp;million people across Jubaland and Hirshabelle states, including Rasulyan and her kids.</p>



<p>“The floods swept away everything we had,” explained Rasuliyan. Lacking a regular income and food, her children were suffering from malnutrition.</p>



<p>On 6 November, the ERC agreed to a $10m CERF allocation. Thanks to preparatory work by OCHA Somalia, partners, and the CERF Secretariat in view of seasonal forecasts, CERF was able to approve all projects under this allocation within 24 hours.</p>



<p>With CERF support, <a href=""https://www.emro.who.int/somalia/news/cerf-support-safeguards-lives-of-959-of-children-at-who-supported-stabilization-centres-in-somalia.html"">WHO helped federal and state ministries of health to boost their efforts to meet the growing needs of over 500&nbsp;000 displaced people.</a> including Rasulyan and her children.</p>



<p>WHO deployed over 25 outreach teams – comprising 100 health workers in total: nurses, clinicians, social workers and nutrition screeners – as well as community health workers.</p>



<p>They were able to identify Rasuliyan’s children as at risk and refer them for treatment.</p>



<p>“My two children have survived not only droughts and floods but are now recovering at the Kismayo General Hospital,” said Rasuliyan.</p>



<p>And with CERF funding, WHO supported 64 stabilization centers across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>CERF is a leader in emergency climate response</em></p>



<p>The Central Emergency Response Fund has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in delivering help where people most need it.</p>



<p>Since its inception, CERF has allocated US $2.3 billion to respond to climate disasters worldwide and has disbursed $90 million for anticipatory action support since 2020.</p>

<p>Mali | 2024 | Regional Fund</p>



<p>Mali, Tidinbawene. “Seeing my son go to school every morning is a privilege I never thought possible,” says Ahmed.</p>



<p>In Mali, over half of a million school-aged children do not have access to education because increasing insecurity has led to the closure of more than 1,700 schools.</p>



<p>With support from the Regional Fund for West and Central Africa, the school in Tidinbawene reopened in 2023, giving Ahmed’s son and other children a chance to get back to school.</p>



<p>Two Malian NGOs, AMSS and FEDE, repaired the school, trained teachers and ensured students received the supplies they needed. The project also stocked up school canteens to ensure hunger was not an obstacle to learning.</p>



<p>“Education has returned with new strength, thanks to this intervention,” said proud father Ahmed.</p>



<p>“Returning to my classroom was an indescribable experience,” adds Lalla, one of the teachers. “These rooms, once deserted, are filled again with the laughter of children.”</p>



<p>Elsewhere in Mali, the Regional Fund supported healthcare and nutrition interventions that also helped children get back to school.</p>



<p>The commune of Koro faces some of the highest levels of humanitarian need in the country. Many women lack access to specialized healthcare.</p>



<p>Teachers noticed children were missing school due to illness. “When children are sick, they skip school. We often helplessly observe the absenteeism,” explains a teacher in Koro.</p>



<p>With funding from the Regional Fund, ACTED’s project aims to increase access to maternal health and nutrition support in the commune. The project supported six health centres, providing free care and deploying a mobile clinic for people in rural areas.</p>



<p>“So, now we can take the children to the health centre to get help when they don’t feel well,” the teacher explains.</p>



<p>Access to health care has also been very important for pregnant women and new mothers.</p>



<p>“Without this free service, I would have had to stay home with no prenatal check-ups - like my previous pregnancies - because we can't afford it,” explained one expectant mother.</p>



<p>“I am really happy to have been assisted by the project – and without paying medical fees. I hope you can continue to help us with initiatives like this. We notice that a lot of people need it,” she added.</p>

<p>Mali, Angsongo. Tagalif lives at the Cap d’Angsongo displacement site along with about 600 other people. After&nbsp;an attack by armed groups, he and his neighbours&nbsp;were forced&nbsp;to leave their village. “We have lost everything since we left Tabango,” he explains.</p>



<p>Prolonged conflict and recurrent climate shocks in Mali are worsening the humanitarian crises, which have already displaced hundreds of thousands of people within the country.</p>



<p>The Ansongo district, located in Mali’s Gao region, is facing a continuously deteriorating humanitarian and security situation. For over 10 years, insecurity has been a major concern in this region, which borders Niger and Burkina Faso, because of active armed groups.</p>



<p>This situation forces many families to flee their villages, seeking refuge in displacement sites on the outskirts of Ansongo. In these places, living conditions are precarious. Access to healthcare is limited, and diseases such as malnutrition, respiratory infections and waterborne illnesses are widespread.</p>



<p>Since December 2023, Première Urgence Internationale has been intervening to help address people’s urgent needs for health and psychosocial support, thanks to the support of the Regional Humanitarian Fund for West and Central Africa.</p>



<p>PUI has deployed a mobile clinic that provides medical and nutritional assistance. The mobile clinic consists of a doctor, a midwife, a nurse and a community mobilizer, who offer consultations, care and free medications to all patients. Tagalif and his wife fell ill after arriving in Ansongo, but thanks to the mobile clinic, they received the care they needed and recovered.</p>



<p>“When the Première Urgence mobile clinic arrived at the site, we went to see the doctor who gave us prescriptions. He then directed us to the nurse, who gave us the medications for free.”</p>



<p>The clinics also include mental health support services. “The clinic’s team takes care of all the people living at this site, whether they are men, women, or children,” adds Tagalif.</p>

<p><strong>Afghanistan, CAR, Somalia, Sudan, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Yemen.</strong> In an emergency, local and national organizations are often the best equipped to provide water, food, shelter and other life-saving essentials for people in need.</p>



<p>And they are there before anyone else.</p>



<p>On the front lines when crises begin, and building on strong local connections, local organizations help vulnerable people through the worst days of their lives, delivering life-saving assistance.</p>



<p>OCHA’s Country-based Pooled Funds support our local partners. In 2023, the Country-based Pooled Funds together allocated over $338 million to local and national partners. 45 per cent of our partnerships were with local and national partners.</p>



<p><em>First to act on the front lines</em></p>



<p>In the first weeks of the war in Gaza, <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/ochas-pooled-funds-enable-lifesaving-humanitarian-response-for-people-in-gaza"">Ma’An Development Center distributed emergency supplies</a> and fresh drinking water, winter jackets, blankets, and baby supplies in Rafah, Khan-Younis, and other affected areas.</p>



<p>In Sudan, United Peace Organization distributed essential household supplies to displaced families under siege in El Fasher. “Despite the poor conditions and the ongoing shelling, our team refused to do anything but complete the task and deliver humanitarian aid to those in need,” said <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mohamed-adam-487a47236_despite-the-indiscriminate-shelling-and-the-activity-7201192222971543552-FiK_/"">Mohamed Adam, a program officer with UPO.</a></p>



<p><em>Protection and education</em></p>



<p>For the millions of children affected by protracted conflict, education, psychosocial assistance, and protection activities are a lifeline, providing a sense of normalcy and a chance for repair.</p>



<p>OCHA’s Country-based Pooled Funds support local and national organizations to do this work.</p>



<p>In Somalia, Zeituna can make art <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/providing-a-safe-space-to-play-in-somalia"">in a child-friendly space at Iftin displacement</a> site. Somali organization NoFYL supported such spaces in several displacement sites, giving Zeituna and other displaced children respite from crisis situations and a place for healthy activities.</p>



<p>NoFYL is among the Somali organizations who received over 75 per cent of the Somalia Humanitarian Fund’s standard allocation this year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile in Ukraine, ‘100% Life’, a Ukrainian NGO focusing on education, received $640,000 via a sub-grant from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to deploy mobile classrooms to war-torn, front-line communities. These classrooms gave children – including disabled children – an opportunity to learn in the midst of conflict.</p>



<p>In Central African Republic, <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/child-protection-getting-counselling-learning-new-skills"">young people who have left armed groups</a> are able to access mental health care and practical livelihoods training, with support from local organization Esperance, funded by the CAR Humanitarian Fund.</p>

<p>Across the world in Venezuela’s rural Delta Amacuro, <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/delivering-assistance-for-women-doctor-and-interpreter"">Dr. Soila Palacios supports protection programming for women in her community.</a> Her translation work supports a project with Venezuelan organization El Paraguero and HIAS, combining livelihood interventions to improve food security with health surveillance and discussion on protection issues.</p>



<p>In Afghanistan, <a href=""https://www.unocha.org/news/afghanistan-humanitarian-fund-10-years-front-lines"">Nawroz can visit a health clinic for a pre-natal check,</a> the first time in a long time she’s had access to quality care in her rural village. In July 2023, the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund launched a dedicated “localization allocation” of $12.9 million , to support Afghan organizations like the Bakhtar Development Network.</p>



<p>For Nawroz, the project makes a difference. “I deeply appreciate the compassionate and professional care I received at the hospital. It’s a necessity for women and their children in rural areas.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>A global priority</em></p>



<p>OCHA’s Country-based Pooled Funds <a href=""https://www.unocha.org/news/ocha-launches-annual-report-2023"">have prioritized increasing funding for local and national organizations.</a></p>



<p>In 2023, 45 per cent of CBPF partners - or 344 organizations - were local and national NGOs and Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies. This is the largest ever share of local partners directly receiving CBPF funding.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Overall, nearly 40 per cent of total allocations went to local partners.</p>



<p><em>Partnership makes a difference</em></p>



<p>In Yemen, Mohsen’s son was born safely via caesarean section in Ahwar General Hospital. The hospital had lacked an operating room for several years, but Yemeni organization Field Medication Foundation rehabilitated the facility, including a fully stocked operating room, with support from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>When the doctor told Mohsen his wife needed a C-section, “I was prepared to transfer her to Razi Hospital in Zinjibar Abyan, which is three hours away,” says Mohsen, “but the doctor surprised me by saying that the operation could be performed here. At first, I couldn't believe it. Thankfully, the operation was successful, and my wife and son are fine.”</p>

<p><strong>Nigeria, Monguno, Borno State. </strong>After being displaced from her home in 2015, Kellu Angoshe’s dream was to return to school.</p>



<p>Originally from Marte Local Government Authority (LGA) in Borno State, Kellu, her parents and six siblings, were forced to relocate due to the insurgency.</p>



<p>They moved to Monguno LGA and settled in the Government Girls Secondary School (GGSS) camp. Access to formal education was limited in the camp. Kellu's only option was to attend a distant ‘mega school’, which was difficult for her because of her physical disability.</p>



<p>Kellu represents many girls and boys in north-east Nigeria, who are unable to stay in school due to conflict, displacement and Covid. The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains dire. Across Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) states, over 7.9 million people face severe protection concerns, extreme deprivation beyond existing poverty levels, and daily threats to their well-being. The severity and complexity of affected people’s needs have not diminished.</p>



<p><em>Hope knocks at Kellu’s door</em></p>



<p>Fortunately, lady luck smiled on Kellu in January 2023 when through the door-to-door approach, she was selected and enrolled in the accelerated basic education programme implemented by GoalPrime Organisation (GPON) with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF).</p>



<p>Through the programme, children who have fallen behind in their studies due to conflict and displacement have an opportunity to catch up. &nbsp;Kellu received a complete enrolment kit containing a school bag, uniforms, sandals, pens, pencils, books, stockings, and an eraser: all vital for her educational journey. In addition, the programme’s psychosocial support (PSS) activities and social-emotional learning (SEL) helped Kellu transform from a shy and reserved young girl to an active participant in school activities.</p>



<p>“My classmates and I wrote a song to encourage other children to return to school,” Kellu said excitedly. The song was part of the GPON Monguno back-to-school campaign and helped them express their joy at being able to study again.</p>



<p>Kellu also actively participated in the Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) sessions for adolescent girls, providing them with the knowledge and supplies they need to manage their menstruation safely and with dignity. At the end of the sessions, the girls get an MHM kit containing reusable sanitary pads, washing and bathing soap, underwear, a menstrual calendar, a hair comb, a toothbrush, slippers, toothpaste, and educational materials on menstrual health and hygiene.</p>



<p><em>A role model emerges</em></p>



<p>Her passion for learning has seen Kellu excel academically while her participation in various activities has made her a role model for her peers to emulate. “Kellu’s progress has been remarkable, and it is inspiring to see her do really well and grow in confidence,” noted one of her teachers.</p>



<p>Kellu’s story is a testament to the positive impact of the accelerated basic education programmes. When vulnerable young girls are provided with education and life skills these will help them throughout their lives.</p>

<p>Maskanah, Rural Aleppo, Syria. Hassoun Al-Aboud knows the struggle of living without clean water.</p>



<p>After the earthquake in February 2023, damaged pipes left him and his neighbours without running water. With eleven children to care for, Hassoun was deeply worried.</p>



<p>“Getting water was a huge challenge,” Hassoun says. He had to travel long distances and pay exorbitant prices just to keep his family safe. Even then, the water he bought still had to be purified.</p>



<p>With funding from the Syria Humanitarian Fund,  ZOA has repaired and replaced the community’s water pipeline. “This work has made a big difference. Now, clean water flows right to my house.”</p>



<p>Hassan’s family can drink without worrying, and it’s much easier to take care of his lemon and orange trees.</p>



<p><em>Repairs are making homes safer</em></p>



<p>The earthquake destroyed and damaged thousands of homes.</p>



<p>“It was the first time in my life that I’d experienced something as strong as this,” explained Mustafa, a retired teacher who lives with his wife in Aleppo.</p>



<p>The earthquake cracked his walls, but even so, his house provided refuge for two of his married children and their families who have had to sell their homes because of the economic crisis here.</p>



<p>With SHF funding, NGO Secours Islamique France helped repair the house so that the family can feel safer and more secure - together.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan and Yemen| 2023 | CERF and CBPF</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sudan and Yemen.</strong> OCHA’s pooled funds and our partners provide the most effective assistance for people during humanitarian crises – by strategically working together and complementing crucial efforts.</p>



<p>When CERF and CBPF funding is allocated to the same emergency, the Humanitarian Coordinator ensures these funds are used coherently.</p>



<p>In Yemen and Sudan, for example, OCHA’s Pooled Funds worked together in 2023 to help people affected by escalating conflict. Funding helped people access healthcare, battle malnutrition, and rebuild their livelihoods, among other assistance.</p>



<p><em>In Yemen, the Funds worked together to battle malnutrition and provide healthcare</em></p>



<p>“There is nothing that makes me prouder than to see a young child strongly recover from malnutrition,” <a href=""https://careyemen.org/media-center/scaling-up-integrated-health-response-for-life-saving-impact/"">says Sana, a health worker with a mobile clinic in the Khanfar district</a>, run by Care International.</p>



<p>Funding from the Yemen Humanitarian Fund supported health response in remote areas of Khanfar District, reaching women and children with malnutrition screening<a href=""https://careyemen.org/media-center/scaling-up-integrated-health-response-for-life-saving-impact/""> and other essential care.</a></p>



<p><a href=""https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/yemen/yemen-humanitarian-needs-overview-2024-january-2024"">Yemen continues to face a complex protection crisis driving humanitarian needs in the country.</a> Civilian casualties and protracted large-scale displacement profoundly affect people across the country. Even in areas with improved stability and security, the effects of the crisis persist.</p>



<p>In July 2023, the Yemen Humanitarian Fund allocated $7 million to improve people’s living conditions and help address health and protection risks for returnees and people living in protracted displacement - as well as the communities hosting them.</p>



<p>Funding supported the Care health clinic as well as <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/making-learning-more-comfortable"">improvements to schools destroyed and damaged by conflict</a>; access to specialized services for <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/hope-for-children-living-with-disability"">children living with disability</a>; and cash assistance and <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/safe-water-for-communities-affected-by-conflict"">clean water</a> for <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/cash-assistance-helps-yemens-most-vulnerable-families"">vulnerable families living in protracted displacement</a>.</p>



<p>Complimenting this funding, CERF allocated $20 million from its Underfunded Emergencies round in September 2023, to provide humanitarian assistance for returnees, displaced people, and host communities, focusing on nutrition, food security and famine prevention.</p>



<p>With CERF funding, the World Health Organization supported therapeutic feeding centres in Al Jumhuri Hospital in Hajjah.</p>



<p>This meant Zuhoor could bring her four-month-old baby in for treatment. She was worried, as her baby barely weighed two kilograms.</p>



<p>At the centre, she was able to access emergency help – and that means her child will survive. “My child is feeling better now, and we are being taken care of. The services are free of charge,” she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Redhwan lives in Taiz governorate with his family. He breeds goats, collects and sells wood, and does other day labour jobs to earn a living.</p>



<p>CERF funding allowed the Food and Agriculture Organization to provide families with cash and livestock in Taiz, to help strengthen their livelihoods in the longer term.</p>



<p>For Redhwan, a father of five, the CERF funding meant cash to buy the basics. “I was able to buy some sugar, fish, flour and other food for the family. I used the second cash transfer to build a cage for my animals.”</p>



<p><em>In Sudan, the Funds worked together to maximize geographic reach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>When the conflict escalated in Sudan in April 2023, the already dire situation became catastrophic. The number of people needing humanitarian aid surged by sixty per cent, and millions were displaced, including pregnant and nursing mothers who needed essential health services.</p>



<p>“Lubna was one of the first patients we registered with the reproductive health mobile clinic,” said Dr. Ruaa, <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/emergency-mobile-health-care-for-expectant-mothers-and-babies"">who works at a clinic in Kosti supported by UNFPA with SHF funds</a>. “We hope that all pregnant women in the gathering site can now give birth safely.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A $37 million allocation was launched by the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF) early in the conflict. SHF supported a consortium of humanitarian partners <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/local-ngos-supported-by-ochas-pooled-funds-are-on-the-front-lines-of-humanitarian-response"">and grassroots organizations to deliver</a> in Khartoum and Darfur states where access was more difficult.</p>



<p>For example, the United Peace Organization, with funding from the SHF, has built huts to provide <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=shelter&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7208776745150222336"">safe shelter for over 800 displaced families in El Fasher.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, in Kassala, SHF funding allowed Care International to provide basic health services to Nahid and her children, who had fled fighting in Aj Jazirah state.</p>



<p>“Three of my five kids became very sick after the long and hard journey fleeing the fighting in Aj Jazirah. When we arrived here in this school in Kassala, they were coughing badly and had a high fever. I had no money to take them to the doctor and I did not know what to do,” said Nahid.</p>



<p>The SHF allocations were complimented by CERF funding. An initial $22 million in June 2023 through its Rapid Response window complemented an $18 million Underfunded Emergencies allocation, which was reprioritized to address the most time-critical and life-threatening needs arising from the new conflict. In August 2023 CERF allocated a further $20 million to respond to increasing needs.</p>



<p>The CERF Rapid Response allocations strengthened humanitarian response by increasing life-saving services across all clusters in locations with fewer access constraints – where over two-thirds of the displaced people, at the time, were located.</p>



<p>This included emergency livelihoods response to <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/pooled-funds-support-small-farmers-to-produce-food"">help plant seeds and avert a famine</a>; <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/emergency-mobile-health-care-for-expectant-mothers-and-babies"">emergency medical care for expectant mothers and their children</a>; safe spaces <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/a-place-to-play-pooled-funds-support-space-for-displaced-children"">for displaced children to play and access psychological aid</a>, and <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/pooled-funds-provide-people-on-the-move-with-clean-water-and-sanitation"">clean water and sanitation for people on the move inside and outside Sudan.</a></p>



<p>Furthermore, the CERF RR allocation supported the overall humanitarian response with crucial common services like telecommunications, safety and security, and the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS).</p>



<p>The timing of these CERF and HF allocations allowed partners to sustain ongoing response efforts and adjust to a rapidly changing operational environment.</p>



<p>As needs continue to rise in Yemen and Sudan this year, OCHA’s pooled funds will continue to complement one another - and other funding sources - to support the humanitarian response that helps people through such difficult times.</p>

<p>Niger | 2024 | CERF</p>



<p>A pilot project in south-west<a href=""https://www.unocha.org/niger""> Niger</a> has shown that acting before people experienced a drought’s impact enabled them to preserve land, save livestock and avoid negative coping strategies.</p>



<p>Niger is now increasingly prone to droughts, with climate change causing its temperatures to rise 1.5 times faster than anywhere else in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p> In early August 2022, data revealed south-west Niger had received the lowest rainfall in 30 years in June and July. This triggered the OCHA-facilitated <a href=""https://www.unocha.org/anticipatory-action"">anticipatory action</a> framework to reduce the drought’s impact on 160,000 people. These frameworks use a model or forecast to trigger pre-arranged financing for pre-agreed activities to mitigate the impact of an imminent crisis. The OCHA-managed <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Central Emergency Response Fund</a> (CERF) released US$9.5 million in August, months earlier than a traditional response.</p>



<p><em>The impact</em></p>



<p>More than 80 per cent of Niger’s population depend on agriculture, making communities particularly vulnerable to temperature rises and changing rainfall patterns<a href=""https://gain-new.crc.nd.edu/ranking"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">. Niger is the most vulnerable country</a> to climate change in terms of access to food production and fresh water supplies.</p>



<p>Given this dependence on agriculture, CERF funded cash-for-work programmes that employed more than 15,000 people, including women and youths, to create firebreak strips to secure grazing areas. As a result, animals had forage during the lean season, and people had cash to replenish their food stocks locally through village traders, further supporting the local economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A qualitative evaluation by Reos Partners and STRAT-CORE Plus found that cash-for-work programmes led to real change, with more than 80 per cent of beneficiaries surveyed finding this intervention highly relevant.</p>



<p>Parents received education grants that kept more than 10,000 children in school, and 1,300 girls who were about to complete their secondary-school exams received scholarships to ensure they could finish their education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tens of thousands of people avoided drought-related illnesses, as they had easier access to health care and water. More than 2,000 households benefited from rehabilitated drinking water supply systems, and a further 6,000 households could drink water at home due to the distribution of water treatment products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Louise Aubin, the former UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator for Niger, explained: “By giving 160,000 people in Niger the resources they needed ahead of time to preserve harvests, protect livestock, purchase food and access health care, they were not forced to migrate, to take children out of school, or significantly reduce food consumption. This not only led to less suffering but reduced the cost of more expensive interventions later.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Takeaway</em></strong></p>



<p>More investment in climate adaptation is essential to strengthen vulnerable communities' long-term resilience to cope with increasing floods and droughts. However, the pilot demonstrated that anticipatory action contributes by helping people avoid negative coping strategies ahead of climate shocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communities wished the pilot project had reached larger numbers of people along with interventions that go beyond anticipatory action.</p>



<p>Niger is one of the four countries where the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.unocha.org/flagship-initiative"">Flagship Initiative</a> is being piloted. It aims to transform humanitarian assistance, ensuring it is driven by the priorities of the people OCHA serves and increases their self-sufficiency.</p>



<p>Lisa Doughten, Director of OCHA’s Financing and Partnerships Division, said: “The piloting of the Flagship Initiative in Niger, South Sudan, the Philippines and Colombia focuses on listening to communities, so the humanitarian community understands their priorities and how best to support them in planning ahead to respond to shocks. We are hearing that communities want to have the tools to strengthen their resilience to climate crises. Increased investment in anticipatory action, along with linking it to more development and climate action, will be key to responding to these priorities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The OCHA-facilitated collective anticipatory action framework for drought in Niger was updated in early 2024. An anticipatory action framework for floods is now being explored, as parts of Niger often experience severe flooding.</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Akkar and North.</strong> In early 2024, heavy rains and flash floods affected parts of Lebanon, including North and Akkar states. The rising water levels flooded roads, homes, and businesses in areas like Al-Abdeh and Al-Kanisah in the Akkar Governorate.</p>



<p>Syrian refugee camps on the Akkar plain faced substantial damage, with tents submerged in water, rendering them uninhabitable and ruining the few items refugee families have managed to keep.</p>



<p>Souad shared her harrowing experience: ""At 7 o’clock in the morning, we awoke to a distressing sight - water had inundated our tents. We swiftly gathered ourselves and our children, leaving everything behind. When we returned two days later, we discovered our mattresses, food, and the tent frame all irreparably damaged. We were left with nothing!""</p>



<p>Souad’s story echoes the struggles faced by many families affected by the extreme weather.</p>



<p>Many families sought refuge with relatives, while others waited out the storm in a nearby <a href=""https://www.alhurra.com/lebanon/2024/01/13/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%BA%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%AE%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86"">construction site</a> with no windows or doors, enduring harsh conditions. In this makeshift shelter, they endured a challenging 48 hours without food, water, or heating.</p>



<p>With funding from the OCHA-managed Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, NGO Anera distributed food rations to families affected by the floods. This filled a critical gap in response efforts, ensuring people got much-needed help as they grappled with the aftermath of the rains.</p>

<p>Lebanon | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Nahr el-Bared, Beddawi, and Wavel refugee camps. </strong>Amina is eighty years old. When she was three years old, she and her family fled Nazareth to Lebanon. Since then, she has lived in refugee camps here.</p>



<p>As she’s gotten older, Amina has suffered from severe curvature in her spine. It makes it difficult to move around.</p>



<p>“I haven’t been able to walk around Wavel camp in six years. The most I can do is visit my neighbour,” she said, pointing to the door right next to hers. “And even that I can’t do without someone’s help!”</p>



<p>Like many vulnerable elders living in the refugee camps, Amina lacked access to assistive devices, physiotherapy and other support that would make life more comfortable and convenient.</p>



<p>With support from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, local organization Taawon provided 700 elders in Beddawi, Nahr El-Bahd and Wavel camps with access to protection and health services, including wheelchairs and other devices, physiotherapy, and surgical support where needed.</p>



<p>Amina now has a wheelchair, and was looking forward to strolls around the camp with her granddaughter, unthinkable just a short while ago.</p>



<p>The support is both practical and important for people’s emotional health.</p>



<p>“I feel taken care of and appreciated when the nurse and physiotherapy team comes to visit me, and checks on my health,” said Ali Rahil, who also lives in Wavel camp and faces mobility challenges. “The new walking cane for me is quite literally my backbone. I used to borrow a cane from my neighbour, but having one of my own feels like an accomplishment.”</p>



<p>For Kassem Sarhan, aged 72, the economic crisis in Lebanon meant he had to give up physical therapy so that he could afford medication. “Thankfully he is back in physiotherapy, thanks to this project,” explains his wife Sahar.</p>



<p>Like Mr. Rahil, Mr. Sarhan looks forward to the social aspects of the programme as well. “My husband loves people and people love him. The recreational activities boost his morale,” adds Sahar.</p>

<p>Many families here face severe hardship because of the conflict. With funding from the DRC Humanitarian Fund, COOPI is responding to urgent nutrition and protection needs in Mambasa and other vulnerable regions of the country.</p>



<p>“I heard about COOPI’s free health services on the radio. I took Kavira to the health center, and she was then referred for specialized treatment,” explains Stephanie.</p>



<p>At the hospital in Biakato, Kavira underwent eight days of intense treatment with special medication, milk, and Plumpy’Nut. COOPI supported the clinic and also Stephanie’s transportation and basic needs like food while she was with her daughter.</p>



<p>Now Kavira is doing better, walking and playing like any child her age. Stephanie wishes her own life could return to normal as well.</p>



<p>“We used to depend on agriculture”, says Stephanie. “But because of the fighting, it is no longer a realistic way of earning a living.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Afghanistan | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Afghanistan, Baghdis. </strong>At fifty-five, Gul Jan is supporting her grandchildren. “I came here today to receive some cash,” she explains. “My grandchildren will be so happy, as I will buy them good food and clothes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afghanistan is experiencing the ongoing impact of decades of conflict, years of drought conditions, and chronic and continued poverty. The situation has worsened with the severe economic decline since the Taliban takeover in August 2021.</p>



<p>Water scarcity, poor food security, and health, nutrition, shelter, and education-related needs all remain high. And in 2024, an estimated 23.3 million people will require humanitarian assistance to survive. </p>



<p>The cash project in Baghdis province that is helping Gul Jan and her family is supported by the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund. And it is women who are managing the cash distributions to female-headed households, thereby creating a safe and accessible space for recipients.</p>



<p>Restrictions on women's work and freedom continued to tighten during 2023, with implications for education, healthcare, and other sectors: yet, throughout Afghanistan, the role of female aid workers in humanitarian response remains critical.</p>



<p>For many women like Gul Jan, being able to interact with a woman service provider is critical to feeling safe.</p>



<p>Launched in 2014, the OCHA-managed Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) has become a cornerstone of humanitarian response in the country, exceeding US$1 billion in disbursements in the last ten years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past decade, the AHF has supported Afghan non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and women-led organizations to empower and enable the country’s worst-affected communities.</p>

<p>CAR | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Central African Republic. </strong>Asta Fakitoum founded Zo Kwe Zo, an organisation deeply rooted in the Central African Republic (CAR). Meaning “All humans are equal” in Sango, it was initially formed in 2006 to respond to the conflict that devastated the northwest of the country, and help widows, orphans, and other vulnerable people.</p>



<p>Since then Zo Kwe Zo have broadened their activities to address other critical issues affecting the community like explosive device risks, in collaboration with Humanity and Inclusion (HI) and the CAR Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/OCHA_CAR/status/1510970050320244736"">Civilians are the main victims</a> of explosive devices in CAR. More than three-quarters of the casualties of 82 incidents in 2023 were civilians: 27 people, including 19 children. In the first half of 2024, 14 people, including seven civilians, have already been killed in 33 incidents.</p>



<p>The last three years have seen a significant increase compared to 2020, when only two incidents, with no casualties, were registered*. People are severely restricted in their movements in this region where food insecurity remains critical, preventing them from using roads and paths to get to work and to farm produce. Explosive ordinance can also hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid, so training and capacity-building of de-mining organizations is essential.</p>



<p>Ms. Fakitoum and her colleagues recently joined a training series aimed at helping organizations in the region better understand international funding systems and requirements, which also built technical capacity to implement explosive ordinance awareness programmes in CAR.</p>



<p>From CAR, the Association of Women for Entrepreneurship (AFPE) and Zo Kwe Zo both took part to strengthen their technical know-how. They asked HI to be their partner.</p>



<p>“Humanity and Inclusion is the only actor implementing an Explosive Remnants of War Risk Education – or EREE - response. We were approached by Zo Kwe Zo and AFPE to support them in this field due to the resurgence of explosive devices,” said M. De Gaillande, HI project director. “It is very rare to find funding opportunities to support this type of mentorship,” he added. “This funding from the CAR Humanitarian Fund truly advances localization.”</p>



<p>With the support of HI support, the two organizations obtained UNMAS accreditation and have so far conducted awareness and safety campaigns for 10,000 people. &nbsp;It is the first time in CAR that UNMAS has accredited two national organizations to conduct risk education activities on explosive devices.</p>



<p>The training also helped the local organizations understand ways of seeking international funding. “We feel capable of managing larger funding envelopes, pursuing mine risk education programming, and extending and deepening our work in the community,” explained Ms. Fakitoum.</p>

<p>Nigeria, Adamawa state. Uwani was worried when she found out she was pregnant with twins. “I always suffered during my previous pregnancies,” she explained. A friend advised her to visit the women’s safe space – Dakin Kwanciyan Hankali – at Fufore camp.</p>



<p>The humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains dire, with women and girls the worst affected. Across Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) states, over 7.9 million people face severe food insecurity, protection concerns, extreme deprivation beyond existing poverty levels, and daily threats to their well-being.</p>



<p>As in other conflict settings, the chaos and uncertainty of displacement leads to sexual violence and more risk for women and girls.</p>



<p>The Nigeria Humanitarian Fund supported women’s safe spaces for women and girls living in displacement, in partnership with UNFPA.</p>



<p>Uwani attended learning sessions at the safe space, which provided information on the benefits of spacing children, and other health advice. After she gave birth to her twins, she opted for a three-year contraceptive implant, so that she could decide the next time she would be pregnant.</p>



<p>“Before this, I was pregnant almost every year. My encounter with UNFPA gave me peace of mind,” she said.</p>



<p>The safe space also offers life-skills training. Uwani learned some new skills like soap making to earn some extra money. Perhaps more important, she shares the information about women’s health that she learned.</p>



<p>“At weddings, naming ceremonies, or when we are fetching water, I talk to women about child spacing and giving birth at the hospital because I know how important it is. I also encourage my fellow women to learn a particular skill so that they can be empowered and help their husbands,” Uwani said.</p>

<p>Nigeria, Pulka IDP camp. “I had almost lost hope. I thought I was going to lose my baby,” said Gambo, recalling how sick her daughter had been. 18-month-old baby Hadiza arrived at Pulka Primary Healthcare Center weighing only 3.8 kilograms. She was very sick with gastroenteritis. </p>



<p>Hadiza, her mother and the rest of their family were forced to flee their ancestral home in Zubulum, Kirawa town in Gwoza Local Government Area, due to conflict. They now live 16 kilometers away in Pulka Internally Displaced Persons Camp E, where access to health services is limited.<em></em></p>



<p>Fourteen years into the conflict, the humanitarian crisis in north-east Nigeria remains profound and widespread. Across Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) states, over 7.9 million people face severe protection concerns, extreme deprivation beyond existing poverty levels, and daily threats to their well-being. The severity and complexity of affected people’s needs have not diminished.</p>



<p>Hadiza was immediately admitted to the health center’s Stabilization Centre, placed on medication and therapeutic feeding.</p>



<p>Within days, Hadiza was showing improvement. After a little more than two weeks, she was discharged to the Outpatient Therapeutic Programme, now weighing 5.4 kilos.</p>



<p>Both the Stabilization Centre and the Outpatient Therapeutic Programme are supported by Premiere Urgence International (PUI) with funding from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) to provide life-saving nutrition services for residents of Pulka.</p>

<p>Sudan, El Fasher. &nbsp;The situation in Sudan remains dire.</p>



<p>The city of El Fasher in Darfur has suffered heavy fighting in recent months, <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/statement-un-resident-and-humanitarian-coordinator-sudan-clementine-nkweta-salami-attacks-al-fasher-enar"">including bombardment targeting hospitals and markets</a> that has killed and injured civilians. </p>

<p>United Peace Organization, a Sudanese NGO, is on the front lines, providing shelter assistance in Zamzam camp with funding from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund. Distributions of household items – like tarpaulins, jerry-cans, and cooking utensils, have reached over 7,000 people.</p>



<p>“Families who had to live under the trees now have shelter to protect them,” explains Mohamed Adam, a programme officer with UPO. “And they are using the jerry-cans we gave them to fetch water.”</p>



<p>Working in El Fasher is dangerous, as deadly fighting continues to wreak havoc on civilians and humanitarian workers alike.</p>



<p>“I leave home before the battles begin,” Adam explains. To get to work and distribute assistance, he and colleagues must pass through some of the most dangerous parts of the city to distribute aid.</p>



<p>“But it’s great to see your work making a difference for people,” he adds.</p>



<p>Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people remain at risk of famine, as Sudan’s public health system is devastated by the conflict.</p>



<p><a href=""https://humanitarianaction.info/article/country-focus-sudan-and-region"">Since the beginning of the war in May 2023,</a><strong> </strong>the Central Emergency Response Fund and the Sudan Humanitarian Fund have allocated $281.2 million ($101.3 million from CERF, and $179.9 million from the SHF)to bring life-saving aid to 4.7 million and 4.6 million people, respectively, across the country.</p>

<p>The oPt Humanitarian Fund is funding the Palestine Save the Children Organization, a Palestinian organization based in Gaza, to support Sara, Dina, and other children like them through the worst days of their lives.</p>

<p>Her counsellor said that Dina is slowly engaging more with her siblings and making new friendships.</p>



<p>Sara was able to go to art therapy with a trained therapist. She drew pictures of broken hearts. However, it helped her start speaking about what had happened, and her feelings.</p>



<p>Sara’s mother also received support and guidance on how to help her daughter through this most difficult journey. “Sara has emerged from silence. She smiles, she speaks, and she makes her art,” her mother explained.</p>

<p><strong>Occupied Palestinian territory, West Bank. </strong>Shatha Greifat is a mother and a nurse, living in Nour Shams refugee camp in Northern West Bank.</p>



<p>Alongside the ongoing war in Gaza, violence has surged in the West Bank, including operations carried out by Israeli forces in Shatha’s own neighbourhood. Her young children are frightened, and her work in front-line health care is more stressful than ever.</p>



<p>Medical Aid for Palestinians, a local organization, provided mental health and psychosocial support services in a programme funded by the oPt Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>“I needed to learn how to take care of myself... to help myself, my children, and the patients I see every day,” Shatha told OCHA, reflecting on the situation and on her participation in the programme.</p>



<p>The initiative allowed Shatha and other affected people to access mental health care through Psychological First Aid Sessions, workshops, and a care kit for children.</p>



<p>Shatha explained that the care kit gave her children games and activities to do during difficult periods, like an operation carried out by Israeli forces in the camp in April this year. Shatha used the kit, as well as what she had learned, to help her children share their emotions and develop ways of coping.</p>



<p>Projects like MAP’s initiative are crucial in providing families like Shatha’s with mental health and psychosocial support. As violence continues to disrupt lives in the West Bank, this work is vital in helping communities support one another.</p>

<p>Colombia | 2024 | CERF</p>



<p>Colombia, Nariño. The people of Sanquianga are severely affected by conflict. Families have to flee their homes because of violent clashes, or find it difficult to access health care, or maintain a reliable means of supporting themselves.</p>



<p>And it takes over a day, travelling by river from the town of Tumaco, to reach the remote area, which encompasses several settlements.</p>



<p>OCHA’s Flagship Initiative aims to pilot innovative solutions and new ways of collaborating with communities like these, and among United Nations entities, to better serve people in times of crisis and to build resilience for the future.</p>



<p>In 2023, the Central Emergency Response Fund allocated USD 5 million to Colombia through its Underfunded Emergencies (UFE) window.</p>



<p>Working with the people of Sanquianga, the money enabled UN agencies and their partners to provide a package of help to meet their immediate needs, as well as support them in developing deeper resilience to cope with living in an uncertain, conflict-affected environment.</p>



<p><em>Safe spaces for learning</em></p>



<p>School refurbishment – implemented through UNICEF, UNFPA, and WFP projects – equipped the region’s schools with better sanitation, and brought parents and students together for workshops on protecting women and children, including mine-risk education. Both are major risks faced by the community.</p>



<p>Women could also join a newly refurbished safe space, where they spoke freely about challenges that affect them and learn from each other about possible solutions.</p>



<p>“We learned about our rights,” said one woman. “We want to actively lead efforts for the well-being of our children, families and communities. This helps us know how to do it.”</p>



<p><em>Farming for the future</em></p>



<p>At the same time, FAO supported community-led initiatives for sustainable farming. Many families and communities rely on coca farming for income. Replacing coca with food production helps them build longer-term food security. Food and cash transfers from WFP helped people with their immediate, emergency needs; while for mothers working the land, the project also provided a childcare center.</p>



<p>Next on the agenda, the project will establish ‘medicine farms’, with the support of FAO and WHO, where people can cultivate medicinal herbs, building on their traditional knowledge. In hard-to-reach areas like this, far from health care, traditional medicine can be a first line of defense.</p>



<p><em>Emergency context</em></p>



<p>Clashes between armed groups meant that some of the people taking part in the project had to flee their homes for safety.</p>



<p>CERF and partners provided them with emergency assistance, including food, cash, and emergency education.</p>



<p>“It could very well be that we are forced to move again because of the conflict. But the knowledge and skills we have gained are ours to keep; no one can take that away from us,” said one woman.</p>



<p><em>Names have been excluded for protection reasons.</em></p>

<p>Gaza, oPt. “My children didn’t have disabilities before the war. But they were severely injured by a bombing, and it has left them with problems with their vision. They haven’t been leaving the house,” explains Umm Ayham, a mother of two.</p>



<p>One year into the crisis, as bombardment continues from the air and land, <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-221-gaza-strip-enhe"">people continue to suffer, and survive, in unimaginably difficult circumstances.</a> 1.9 million people have fled their homes since October of last year. Children are out of school and suffering mentally and physically.</p>



<p>With funding from the oPt Humanitarian Fund, War Child Holland (WCH) and local organization Palestine Save the Children Foundation (PSCF) have embarked on an education project to provide quality, safe, and inclusive education for children across Gaza.</p>



<p>They established children’s centres that offer psychosocial support and basic assistive devices like glasses and hearing aids, helping kids have a bit of normalcy and get back to learning even under such extreme circumstances.</p>



<p><em>Activities offer some respite</em></p>



<p>Life is not normal at all, but the centers offer a respite from trauma and conflict, as well as a safe place to learn, to play, do art and other activities.</p>



<p>Sa’adia says, “I’m so happy to come here. Since the start of the war, we haven’t been able to relax, but at the centre I’ve been able to get involved in everything.”</p>



<p><em>Spectacles and hearing aids help children play and learn</em></p>



<p>Here, Umm Ayham’s two children were finally able to get fitted for glasses. “They can see clearly and are happier,” she said.</p>



<p>Young Karim was fitted for hearing aids. “Today I can hear well! I’m very happy,” he said.</p>



<p>For some children who had been living for years with hearing or vision difficulties, this was the first time they had accessed glasses or hearing aids. “It might seem a small thing, but it has given us new hope,” explained one mother, after her son got his hearing aids.</p>



<p>The project is reaching over 500 children across Gaza, and also offers classes on protection for teachers and parents, to support their children through these difficult times.</p>

<p>Central African Republic | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Central African Republic, Kabo. </strong>For nearly a decade, the people of Kabo, in the northern-central area of CAR have lived in the shadow of armed conflict. The violence has displaced almost 9,000 people, forcing them to flee their homes in search of safety.</p>



<p>Among them is Jeanette, a mother of six, who was uprooted from her village and now resides in Kabo’s Mugumba neighborhood.</p>



<p>“Two years ago, my husband abandoned us. I’ve been raising our six children alone,” Jeanette shared. “I’m a farmer, but with no stable income, life is a constant struggle.”</p>



<p>Her youngest son, only three years old, was recently diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition complicated by severe malaria. Jeanette recalls, “I knew something was wrong when he refused to eat, and his feet began to swell. I’ve heard that malnutrition happens when a diet isn’t balanced, and all we had were cassava, bean, and melon leaves, all cooked with peanut paste and palm oil, along with some cassava, millet, or maize.”</p>



<p>In Kabo, over 13,000 children and pregnant and nursing women are suffering from malnutrition. Thanks to support from the CAR Humanitarian Fund, African Relief Service (ARS), a national&nbsp;non-governmental&nbsp;organization, has provided some 800 children with emergency nutrition, and critical care&nbsp;for those with severe&nbsp;malnutrition. Jeanette’s son was one of them.</p>



<p>“Here in Kabo, they give my son the medicine he needs, and milk every day,” Jeanette says, her relief evident. “The advice and care we’ve received at the hospital have helped my son recover step by step. I’m so grateful to see him getting stronger.”</p>



<p>ARS’ nutrition programme in Kabo, is a lifeline for many displaced families. An organization with deep community roots, ARS hopes to expand&nbsp;community engagement, and with continued funding, reach more children suffering from malnutrition and improve their health.</p>

<p><strong>Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Myanmar, Somalia and Syria. </strong>As climate-related disasters multiply, OCHA’s Pooled Funds are providing quick and flexible funding through local and international organizations - to help people get through the worst.</p>



<p>The Central Emergency Response Fund and the Country-based Pooled Funds offer critical funding for response to climate-related disasters like floods, droughts and disease - quickly and flexibly, around the world.</p>



<p>For example, CERF funding helped people weather the dzud in <strong>Mongolia</strong>, helping them keep their animals <a href=""https://mongolia.un.org/mn/267301-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB-%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4-%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B6-%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B9-%D0%B7%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B4-%D0%BD%D1%8D%D1%80%D0%B2%D1%8D%D0%B3%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%8D%D0%BD-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%87%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B4-%D1%82%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%85-%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BD%D2%AF%D0%B1-%D1%8B%D0%BD-%D1%8F%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B9-%D1%82%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD"">healthy through the lean times</a>.</p>



<p>In <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund supported a programme to rehabilitate a water network whose destruction, combined with climate-change driven drought, was driving a <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/new-water-infrastructure-supports-a-peaceful-rural-community"">community closer to conflict.</a></p>



<p>After devastating cyclones in <strong>Madagascar</strong>, <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/mobile-clinics-provide-vital-support-after-cyclones-and-help-people-prepare-for-future-weather-events"">CERF funding meant critical health clinics could be rehabilitated and re-opened.</a></p>



<p>In the midst of the <strong>Horn of Africa</strong>’s devastating drought, the Pooled Funds <a href=""https://pooledfunds.impact.unocha.org/stories/cerf-helped-people-through-the-climate-emergency-in-east-africa"">provided life-saving help in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia</a>. CERF and CBPF funding have helped deliver safe water, cash, and livestock health care to hundreds of vulnerable households.</p>



<p>“Before the cash distribution, we could barely afford food. But now I can comfortably say my children are getting two solid meals a day,” said Darmi, whose animal herd had been devastated by years of drought in Kenya.</p>



<p>Each year, communities across <strong>Myanmar</strong>’s Rakhine State brace themselves for the near-daily deluges that sweep across the region during the annual monsoon season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The rains arrived, and I was worried the situation would become unmanageable. A lot of people need help to fix their roofs,” says Amraan, a community volunteer at a displacement camp.</p>



<p>With CERF and other funding, <a href=""https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/displaced-families-myanmar-brace-monsoon-season-cyclone-aftermath"">UNHCR worked closely with partner organizations</a> to ensure tarpaulins were distributed, damaged shelters repaired - and then communal facilities were repaired after the seasonal floods.</p>



<p>In <strong>Syria</strong>, the Syria Cross-Border Humanitarian Fund provided water trucking to Al-Hamra camp, which suffered a terrible heat wave last summer. </p>



<p>“We are dying from the heat; we experience extreme fatigue because of it,” said Rasmiya Al-Muhammad, who lives there. “We put the sheets in the water tank and shake them to cool them. We cover ourselves and the children in the sheets just to cool down.”</p>

<p><em>Zimbabwe, Chredzi.  </em>Chredzi district in south-east Zimbabwe is semi-arid – and that’s in a good year.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Poor rains at the end of 2023 meant the harvest was only about half its usual level in early 2024. The El Niño-induced drought has worsened Zimbabwe's already critical food security crisis. Over 6 million people were estimated to be affected by the drought.</p>



<p>People like Auxilla and her neighbours were having to find new ways to supplement their diets and keep themselves and their kids healthy.</p>



<p>OCHA pooled funding helped ensure children stayed healthy in the midst of severe drought and food insecurity.</p>



<p>A CERF Rapid Response allocation of $5 million aimed to help about 400,000 of the worst affected people with nutrition and logistics support, including nutrition screenings,  and storage and transport of cereal stocks.</p>



<p>It also funded community-based care groups to improve children’s health. UNICEF used CERF funding to scale up <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/zimbabwe/stories/chiredzi-care-groups-protecting-childrens-nutrition-light-el-nino"">Health and Childcare groups that reduce child malnutrition.</a></p>



<p>Care groups are mother-led community meetings that prevent malnutrition for kids by learning and cooking together. This activity has helped reduce malnutrition even during these difficult times.</p>



<p>The groups are also looking toward the future, as Auxilla,  the group leader, explains.</p>



<p>“We are in the process of setting up our community garden, where we can grow carrots, tomatoes, beans, and maize for the benefit of our young ones. Some households have also set up fish ponds at their homesteads.”</p>

<p>Bangladesh, Sirajganj.&nbsp; “Every year, our area experiences severe flooding,” says Salma Khatun. “Water floods our home, and snakes also find their way inside. This forces us to take refuge in higher places.”</p>



<p>Salma and her neighbors again faced the floods this year. The Jamuna basin started to swell above the danger line in the first week of July, inundating entire villages along the major rivers.</p>



<p>This activated ‘anticipatory action’ triggers for funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund to the UN and partners – meaning immediate help can get to those communities, helping them prepare and respond.</p>



<p>CERF is leading the way in establishing and financing anticipatory action initiatives, to get assistance to people who need it most before the worst of predictable disasters.</p>



<p>How does Anticipatory Action work?</p>



<p>Predictive analytics can help anticipate humanitarian needs arising from different shocks. This opens a window of opportunity allowing humanitarians to reduce the overall impact of shocks by acting <em>before</em> people actually need help.</p>



<p>In Bangladesh, this meant agreeing pre-agreed triggers and activities to respond to flooding. Assistance like this allows people to allocate resources and make their own choices on how best to get through the crisis.</p>



<p><em>Cash transfers to buy supplies</em></p>



<p>In Bangladesh, once the triggers were activated by burgeoning rainfall, CERF partner WFP sent cash transfers - via mobile phone - to 75,000 families in the districts that were worst hit.</p>



<p>Sabina Yasmin is one mother affected by the floods. “On the day the water rose, we received some money from WFP, which allowed us to buy food using a makeshift raft. This cash assistance was a relief for us,” she said.</p>



<p>Without the money, they wouldn’t have been able to get what they needed. “We bought lentils, salt, and other dry food essentials. Before that, I didn’t have a single penny on hand, so that money made a huge difference,” says Sabina.</p>



<p><em>Basic supplies for women and children</em></p>



<p>Once the funding was activated, UNFPA distributed baby kits and hygiene kits to mothers and women.</p>



<p>Mousumi’s family also had to leave their home. For her and her daughters, the sanitary kits - which include disposable menstrual supplies – were really important. “These pads are much safer than using cloths, which can stay damp and lead to infections.”</p>



<p>Khadiza, who also had to leave her home, said it is hard to be comfortable living in displacement. “The most essential items help with my daily needs during these challenging times.”</p>



<p>For Fatema, who fled with her small baby, having disposable nappies along with fresh blankets and pillows was important. “They make a big difference in taking care of my baby.”</p>



<p><em>Keeping livestock safe.</em></p>



<p>Shaheda, who had to move with her cows because of the flooding, didn’t want to have to sell some of them for a low price just to survive. “If I sell them now, I will only get half the price of what they're worth.""</p>



<p>With animal feed from FAO, also distributed as part of the anticipatory response, she is able to keep her cows alive and healthy, during the crisis – maintaining her savings for later.</p>



<p>Anticipatory action funding is fundamental to CERF’s ongoing response to climate change. While there is no humanitarian solution to the climate crisis, funding like this does help the most at-risk communities be more resilient - and it minimizes loss and damage.</p>

<p><strong>Central African Republic | 2024 | CBPF</strong></p>



<p>Central African Republic, Birao. In Birao, Vakaga Prefecture, people have faced years of armed violence and intercommunal conflict. For more than a decade, violence and the effects of climate change, are driving displacement across the country.</p>



<p>Displaced people and their host communities are dealing with poor infrastructure and a lack of economic opportunities. In the upheaval, women face violence. Children are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, and recruitment as soldiers. &nbsp;And people are hungry. Food is scarce, and expensive.</p>



<p>For Zakya, a 45-year-old mother, the conflict claimed her husband’s life and left her alone to care for her teenaged daughter. Armed groups burned their home, and hunger drove her daughter to make money any way she could, however unsafe. “I had no means to care for her,” Zakya recalls.</p>



<p>Nassir, a father of two, saw his children recruited by armed groups. With limited access to education and food, Nassir feared for their future. “I had no way to support my children, and they left school to join armed groups. It felt as though I had lost them,” Nassir explains.</p>



<p>EPHPHATHA, a Central African NGO, is leading a protection and food security project, with funding from the CAR Humanitarian Fund.</p>



<p>Zakya received tools and training that allowed her to start a small business selling doughnuts and peanut oil. “Now, I can provide for my daughter, and she no longer has to leave home hungry,” says Zakya.</p>



<p>Her daughter also accessed counselling, to help her move on from the dark period in her life.</p>



<p>Similarly, Nassir’s two children, who had been recruited into armed groups, were identified and reintegrated within the community and are now able to return to school. The family received some goats to support their food security – providing some milk and cheese to eat, and a bit to sell, too.</p>



<p>“With this support, my children are back in school, and we have the means to support ourselves,” Nassir shares proudly.</p>



<p>By supporting people’s immediate needs and helping them plan and build for the future, EPHPHATHA is helping to address the worst effects of conflict on this community.</p>

<p>Sudan | 2024 | CBPF</p>



<p><strong>Sudan, Blue Nile and South Kordofan. </strong>As the war in Sudan drags on, people are managing to survive – but under extremely difficult circumstances.</p>



<p>The war has devastated the food supply across the country. Sudan is among four countries with the <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/country/sdn"">highest prevalence of acute malnutrition,</a> and <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/severe-food-insecurity-risk-escalating-sudan-facing-worlds-largest-hunger-crisis"">severe food insecurity continues to escalate</a>.</p>



<p>Rural areas in Blue Nile and South Kordofan States are no exception. Conflict and insecurity have left people unable to farm as much as usual, and food imports are expensive. People are going hungry, and struggling.</p>



<p>One local farmer in Gambarda – Mohammed – said he was starting to think about selling his land just to provide for himself and his children. He didn’t have the money to buy seeds and other farming supplies.</p>



<p>With funding from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, Sudanese organization&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lminternationalorg?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZUKBOcrs83XmNRIidoO4xQkvV0B47DMNQKnd6x2o6dFT6Zd-mmqm16HNMyqC-vnBJ3JRMeuGNWIOUPV8CMjfCRPohCu8fNgdh3c5pbRf9zLaxp271xdb3DUUQ0zgHClnRe-S1YJnZ6_FrmUJTMjC3xaoUa1JRv4aQlBW4TGXFsI5Q&amp;__tn__=-%5dK-R"">LM International</a> is providing critical agricultural support to help Mohammed and others like him in Blue Nile and South Kordofan.</p>



<p>The project provided seeds and tools, as well as trainings on improved farming methods to help people make the most of available resources. Some 1700 households were able to access seeds and tools ahead of the rainy season – allowing them to make the most of planting time.</p>



<p>Now they are harvesting their crops of sorghum, millet, tomatoes, okra and more.</p>



<p>Mohammed said, “The seeds sprouted quickly and benefited from the final rains of the season. My sorghum is growing tall and the quantity of millet, watermelon and okra should cover our needs for almost a year. With the money I will earn from selling a bit of surplus produce I can start reinvesting in my farm.”</p>

<p><strong>Timor-Leste | 2024 | CERF</strong></p>



<p>Timor-Leste, Ermera. &nbsp;Agostina and her husband grow vegetables like cassava and taro in their home garden, providing essential food for their household. Agostina also sells sweets in the local market to get by.</p>



<p>In 2023 El Niño severely affected their community. The rains were delayed, and when they did come, flash floods disrupted the planting season. Her family’s crops failed, even as food prices were soaring.</p>



<p>""There was no rain, the soil became dry, and the crops couldn’t bear fruit because there wasn’t enough water,"" Agostina explains.</p>



<p>Even before this, Timor-Leste had one of the highest rates of malnutrition-related stunting: 44 per cent of families in the area faced severe or moderate food insecurity; and more than half of them experienced water scarcity.</p>



<p>Agostina’s neighbour, Esperança de Castro, a housewife and mother of three young children, faced similar struggles. Providing nutritious meals for her children became a daily challenge.</p>



<p>""I was afraid because I know how badly children can suffer when they don’t have enough good food to eat,"" says Esperança. She remembers how her eldest child was diagnosed with malnutrition four years ago, and spent over three weeks in the hospital recovering.</p>



<p>With funding from the <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/"">United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)</a>, the national government and UN partners launched urgent interventions in six of the worst-affected municipalities, including Ermera, directly reaching over 45,000 people. Three UN agencies—the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme (WFP)—spearheaded the initiative.</p>



<p>The weather event intensified food insecurity, water scarcity, and malnutrition, especially by Spring this year. The <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/what-we-do/allocation/2024/summary/24-RR-TLS-63168"">CERF allocation January 2024</a> aimed to reduce the worst impacts of El Niño-related drought for the most at-risk communities.</p>



<p>Agostina’s family, for instance, received essential food items like rice, pulses, and oil – part of the ‘seeds, food, and multipurpose cash package’ FAO offered affected families. With this help, she was able to use her limited income for other essential needs, like medicine. “This is the first time I have received this kind of support. It’s truly a blessing that has helped us reduce our expenses,” says Agostina.</p>



<p>The funding also helped UNICEF and local partners to run Mother Support Groups and share best practices in managing malnutrition. Esperança found comfort in the support and advice from the group, a community volunteer network that helps mothers and children under five.</p>



<p>CERF funding allowed 165 members of the Mother Support Group to be trained in essential nutrition information that they could then share with others. Agostina learned how to conduct the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) screening for malnutrition. She can now refer cases to the local Community Health Centre for treatment.</p>



<p>Across the municipalities affected, Mother Support Group members have identified over 1,000 children in need of further nutrition support. Over 10,000 mothers received counselling in support of infant and young child feeding.</p>



<p>“This story of resilience, embodied by women like Agostina and Esperança, shines a light on the strength of communities in Timor-Leste as they confront the severe impacts of El Niño”, observed Funmi Balogun, UN Resident Coordinator. “The collaboration between local initiatives and the United Nations has been crucial in offering both immediate relief and long-term solutions.”</p>

<p>Lebanon | CBPFs | 2024</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Beirut. </strong>When Mariam, 27, left her village in southern Lebanon amid escalating bombardment, she left behind her home and life as she knew it. With her four children in tow, she sought safety in a Beirut shelter.</p>



<p>While the shelter provided physical security, the trauma of displacement and the struggle to care for her children was a challenge. “The hardest part was leaving behind the life we had built,” Mariam said. “My children don’t understand why we can’t go back.”</p>



<p>Mariam was particularly worried about her two youngest boys – Ali, aged 3, and baby Hassan, only two months old. Amid the stress of moving, Mariam stopped breastfeeding the baby. She was producing less milk, and she’d also been told – wrongly – that her breast milk was less healthy if she was stressed. She worried about Hassan’s health, and about being able to afford formula.</p>



<p>International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), an international organization, is reaching mothers like Mariam who are living through very dark days with critical information and mental health support, thanks to funding from the <strong>Lebanon Humanitarian Fund</strong>.</p>



<p>Mariam met an IOCC counsellor, who provided one-on-one counselling to dispel myths about breastfeeding. The counsellor said that even if she was stressed or producing less milk, there was no reason to stop breastfeeding altogether if she wished to continue. They helped her increase her milk supply and reintroduce breastfeeding.</p>



<p>At the same time, IOCC connected Mariam with a mental health counsellor to work with her three-year-old son, Ali, who was struggling with jealousy and confusion following his baby brother’s arrival. Quite a normal feeling, but made worse by the stress of having to leave home.</p>



<p>This support helped Mariam to address both her sons’ needs in a time of crisis. “I thought I couldn’t do it, but this has given me some hope,” explained Mariam.</p>



<p>The Lebanon Humanitarian Fund has allocated $24 million under its 2024 First Standard Allocation to meet the critical needs of vulnerable people in Lebanon. Of this, $10 million was specifically directed towards scaling up the emergency response for people with growing needs due to hostilities in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Sudan | 2024 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Sudan, El Fasher.</strong> On 13 October 2024, Dr.Suhiba was performing an operation. “A mortar hit the hospital. I was so worried because the patient’s wounds were open, and everyone was running around me,” she remembers.</p>



<p>A barrage of five artillery shells struck Al-Saudi Maternity Hospital that day – the last hospital open in El Fasher. Destroying the pharmacy and the emergency department, and damaging other parts of the hospital, the blasts injured ten people.</p>



<p>Asma was getting a pre-natal check at the time. “I was so scared. The glass from the windows shattered, and I was injured. But I was more scared for my baby,” she said. “The medical team took care of us.”</p>



<p>El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur State, has been <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/staff-accounts-siege-and-bombardment-sudans-el-fasher-pushes-children-adults-limits-survival"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">under siege </a>for months – due to the roiling conflict that erupted in April 2023.&nbsp;Nationwide, the violence has displaced more than ten million people. The country faces one of the <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/country/sdn"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">world’s most severe nutrition crises</a>, and sexual and reproductive health services have been <a href=""https://www.unfpa.org/resources/sudan-situation-report-16-september-2024"">seriously disrupted</a>. All factors which place pregnant women across the country at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the end of October, Al-Saudi Maternity Hospital was the last hospital in the city, and is now only partially functional.</p>



<p>“Four of my team were injured in the latest shelling,” said Dr. Ahlam Ibrahim, head of the hospital’s mental health department. The department supports mothers-to-be as well as survivors of gender-based violence, <a href=""https://www.unfpa.org/news/sexual-violence-and-conflict-sudan-war-bodies-women-and-girls"">rates of which have skyrocketed</a> amid the conflict. </p>



<p>“We are here to support people psychologically, but we are tired,” Dr. Ibrahim said. “But we can’t stop. We are the only ones left to support the women and girls in El Fasher. We need help now.”</p>



<p>With funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund, the UNFPA Emergency Fund and other donors, UNFPA provided the hospital with three months of fuel and solar panels – temporary help that will keep the doors open at least. UNFPA is also helping to pay maternity ward staff until the end of the year.</p>



<p>CERF funding has helped Sudanese people inside and outside the country as they face displacement and fear. In Libya, CERF funding has helped provide refugees with cash assistance, and in Ethiopia, emergency health and protection.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in Al-Saudi hospital, the uncertainty and fear continue. “The situation is very difficult. They are shelling us every day,” Dr. Suhiba said. “Every day I think it will be my last. But what can I do? I have to stay and help my people.”</p>

<p>Mali | CERF | 2024</p>



<p><strong>Mali, Ménaka. </strong>Aissata (not her real name), remembers the day she fell ill. ""My stomach hurt that day, I was weak and I had no appetite. Worst of all, I had no money and my husband was away,"" she recalls.</p>



<p>More than 72,500 people were displaced in Mali last year, as a result of clashes between rival armed groups, inter-community conflicts and military operations by the Malian armed forces against non-state armed groups. Gao, Kidal, Ménaka, Mopti, Taoudénit and Timbuktu regions are the worst affected, along with areas in the south.</p>



<p>Aissata and her family have been displaced even longer: they were forced to leave their home in Anderamboukane in 2021, because of fighting. Now, she is among the hundreds of thousands of Malians who can’t easily access health care.</p>



<p>Because of the crisis, there are fewer doctors and nurses available. Several hospitals and clinics have had to close. In Ménaka, there is a shortage of medicines and medical equipment. Meanwhile, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition, and other diseases are on the rise as people struggle to cope.</p>



<p>To help Mali maintain quality health services in areas impacted by the insecurity, the World Health Organization, with support from the Central Emergency Response Fund, is providing the Health Ministry with medicines and other supplies, and helping to build the skills of health workers.</p>



<p>They are also funding mobile clinics to get help to isolated people in the centre of Ménaka and in Tidermane and Anderamboukane, the two most dangerous districts.</p>



<p>Thanks to the mobile clinics, Aissata was able to access the care she needed. ""A friend told me about free care provided by health workers who come in a vehicle. I was also given free medicine. If it wasn't for the free consultation that day, I don’t know what I would have done,” the young mother said.</p>



<p>CERF funding has helped train health workers in crisis response. Mohamed Toure is one of them: he also learned epidemiological surveillance and rumour management. Conducting research, surveillance, data collection and rapid detection of post-vaccination side-effects, Toure is also equipped to offer psychological support.</p>



<p>""My role is to provide survivors with relief while helping to reduce their fear and stress,” Mohamed says. Then they can access medical care with confidence and remain in good health,"" he explains.</p>

<p><strong>Colombia, Chocó</strong>. The presence of armed groups in Chocó, Valle del Cauca, and Nariño regions has made life very uncertain and driven many people from their homes. Growing up in Nariño, Heidy saw many people needing support, which made her want to help.  </p>



<p>The last ten years has seen a rise in protection risks for people in Nariño, including displacement, confinement, gender-based violence, landmines, and other restrictions on mobility.</p>



<p>As Heidy says, her village faces significant challenges due to its remote location – it’s two hours by boat to the nearest town. And while there’s only electricity for a few hours each night, it hasn’t stopped Heidy from studying political science and pharmacy online.</p>



<p>She is also active in helping others. At only 22 years old, she is part of the Community Union Council Taijeña, in Nariño province. She founded the group of women leaders with her mother, and together they help women in need.</p>



<p>They work with women affected by violence – both in the home and in the broader conflict. They have helped distribute resilience kits with personal hygiene products, warm clothes, and food to help women and children displaced by the conflict.</p>



<p>Heidy has strengthened her leadership skills by joining the 'Together We Save Lives' initiative, led by UN Women and supported by the Central Emergency Response Fund in collaboration with <em>Fundeas</em>, a Colombian organization.</p>



<p>Through the project, Heidy learned strategies to prevent and mitigate gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. <em>Fundeas </em>worked closely with over 500 women, to train community leaders like Heidy and her mother.</p>



<p>And Heidy has shared what she learned with the women she works with through her own organization.</p>



<p>""This project has given me many tools to become a change agent in my community. The women around me now understand what gender-based violence is, and how we can mitigate and respond to it, saving lives in humanitarian crises,” Heidy emphasizes.</p>



<p>“I believe my story is one of resilience, leadership, and dedication. And I feel that what we set out to do, we can achieve.""</p>



<p>Heidy is committed to continuing her humanitarian work alongside her studies. “What we learn, we must share with girls, young people, and the entire community.”</p>

<p><strong>Haiti, Port-au-Prince</strong>. Marie is 67 years old. She used to sell goods at the market to get by, but since the gang violence in Haiti has escalated she is living in the Colbert Lochard site, a long way from home.</p>



<p>The site was originally a public school and nearly 2,500 people are sheltering there. “I’d never had high blood pressure before this situation. But the sounds of gunfire echo in my head. You’re forced to flee without knowing where to go,” Marie explains.</p>



<p>Since February, Haiti has suffered a surge in gang-related violence targeting critical infrastructure in Port-au-Prince and other cities. It’s estimated that over 50,000 people have been displaced since the start of the year.</p>



<p>The surge in violence has affected Haiti’s already poor healthcare system, complicating access to care for millions of Haitians. The most vulnerable people are the hardest-hit, including over 85,000 living in displacement sites within the capital.</p>



<p>Less than 30 per cent of hospitals and health facilities in Port-au-Prince and Artibonite are still functioning, while most clinics face a shortage of medicines, equipment and other medical supplies.</p>



<p>With CERF funding, the World Health Organization set up mobile clinics to reach people like Marie.</p>



<p>""The mobile clinic helped me a lot today,” she says. “I was feeling unwell and as almost all the hospitals are closed, a friend advised me to come here. The doctors discovered that my symptoms of insomnia, headaches, and fatigue are due to high blood pressure. I received medication and thank God for this care in these chaotic times,"" she added.</p>



<p><em>Escalating gender-based violence</em></p>



<p>""My house was burnt down, the bandits raped me and my daughter, and I was infected with HIV,"" explains Patricia, 57, a mother of six, whose life was turned upside down when armed men invaded her neighbourhood. ""This experience took everything from me, I was half crazy,” confides Patricia - she thought of taking her own life.</p>



<p>Like Patricia, a growing number of women and girls are victims of the escalating violence, which has led to massive displacement and an alarming increase in violence in the last two years. With funding from CERF and other donors, PAHO/WHO is working with Haitian organization TOYA to develop an assistance programme for displaced women in Port-au-Prince. This includes a helpline to connect women with mental health specialists, as well as individual and group psychosocial support.</p>



<p>“Since I was attacked, I’ve been able to receive counselling,” says Patricia. “And this is helping me start rebuilding my life.” Patricia also received resources to launch a small business selling snacks, and cash support allowed her to move with her daughter outside the capital to a rural area, where she feels safer.</p>

<p><strong>DR Congo, Tshopo and Ituri. </strong>&nbsp;In November last year, Mandoko, her husband, and their seven children had to flee their home when the Congo River flooded, submerging their village. ""We had no choice but to flee,"" she recalls. ""We found refuge in a church on the hill but lost all our food. Fortunately, we received help from relatives and neighbours.""</p>



<p>Four months later, when the waters finally receded, they returned home to find only mud-covered wooden debris. ""We lost everything,"" she recalls. ""Now, we are gradually resuming our farming so that we can survive.""</p>



<p>DR Congo<a href=""https://humanitarianaction.info/document/global-humanitarian-overview-2024/article/democratic-republic-congo-1""> grapples with some of the world's most complex humanitarian challenges</a>. An estimated 8.7 million people need urgent humanitarian assistance, stemming from a mix of ethnic, territorial, and resource-based conflicts, compounded by natural disasters like these major floods.</p>



<p>Exceptionally heavy rainfall starting last December caused the Congo River to surge to its highest level since 1961, prompting the Government to declare a hydrological and ecological disaster. The flooding inflicted significant damage across the country.</p>



<p>Mandoko is just one of the 108,000 people displaced by repeated floods in Tshopo in 2024. The floods have destroyed over 5,000 hectares of farmland and crops, disrupting planting and leading to food insecurity and hunger as local market prices rise.</p>



<p>In addition, clean water sources – critical for people and their livestock to stay healthy - were contaminated or destroyed, increasing the risk of disease and making farming difficult.</p>



<p>In response to the crisis, CERF allocated $6 million from its Rapid Response window. Thanks to this support, UNICEF and partners rehabilitated 25 water points in the Tshopo area, reducing the risk of disease and helping families like Mandoko safely rebuild their lives.</p>



<p>A similar project helped communities in Ituri province, where people displaced by conflict were only able to get safe drinking water through water trucking: critical, but unsustainable and expensive in the long term. Clean water points also support women’s safety. Deborah, living in a displacement camp, explains that, “fetching water far from home can come with the risk of rape and violence. By contrast, being able to access safe water within the <a href=""https://x.com/UNICEFDRC/status/1808451209423909180"">camp at the new water points is safer and more secure</a>.”</p>

<p>Syria | 2024| CERF</p>



<p><strong>Northwest Syria</strong>. After thirteen years of conflict, hundreds of thousands of people live in displacement in Syria, in conditions that were meant to be temporary. For Um Musab, in her late fifties, a flimsy tent has been her home for over four years. She shared the space with her daughter and grandchildren. It wasn’t private and it was certainly not comfortable.</p>



<p>""In the summer, we suffered from extreme heat inside the tent. We were afraid of cooking in case the tent burns down,” she explains. “I struggled to keep my children safe from insects, snakes, and scorpions that might get in.""</p>



<p>Um Musab was also very concerned about privacy. ""Conversations between family members could be heard from outside the tents. Without a lock, security was a concern, especially since we are all women and children here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the earthquakes that struck in 2023, the International Organization for Migration and Syrian partner Social Development International constructed new and more dignified shelters for 500 vulnerable families across the region, thanks to funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund.</p>



<p>Um Musab and her family were able to move into one of these new units – offering durability, protection from harsh weather, and much-needed privacy and security.</p>



<p>While life isn’t easy, the new peace of mind makes a difference. ""Now we have a door, a window, and a wall we can lean on. There is a lock and key, and we now have a kitchen, a sink, and a bathroom. An incredible difference,"" adds Um Muhammad.  </p>

<p><strong>Northwest Syria. </strong>“The water situation was tragic,” recalls Mustafa, who is living in a displacement camp in Northwest Syria since fleeing fighting many years ago.</p>



<p>It was always expensive to get safe water here. But in February 2023, the earthquakes dealt a further blow, crippling vital water infrastructure. Mustafa, his wife and children, and their neighbours remained without water for three straight weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We had to gather multiple families to afford a full tank together. We simply couldn’t afford it. If there weren’t enough families to chip in, the vendor just wouldn’t come to refill the tank,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mustafa's camp, like many others, faced prolonged water shortages due to earthquake damage to a crucial elevated water tank.</p>



<p>But amid the despair, they remained hopeful. </p>



<p>With funding support from CERF and others, the International Organization for Migration and its Syrian partners rebuilt three elevated water tanks, restoring the clean water for over 67,500 people, including Mustafa and his family. </p>



<p>Now, they have access to safe water every day – easing at least one daily worry. </p>

<p>Lebanon | 2024 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Lebanon, Beirut and other locations.</strong> <a href=""https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/displaced-families-lebanon-yearn-peace-and-return-home"">Umm Hassan fled Nabatieh,</a> a city in southern Lebanon, with her daughter and grandchildren, after their home was damaged in a bombing. They had to drive for two days to reach Beirut. &nbsp;That car journey should normally take no more than two hours.</p>



<p>At first, they slept in their car. In October 2024, along with about 1,200 other people, they were sheltering in a school in Beirut’s Burj Hammoud neighborhood. Three quarters of Lebanon’s public schools were serving as emergency shelters.</p>



<p>Since September 2024, the confrontation between Israeli forces and Hezbollah has devastated people’s lives. Funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund is helping humanitarian organizations respond to the unfolding crisis.</p>



<p>On 14 October 2024, the CERF allocated <a href=""https://cerf.un.org/what-we-do/allocation/2024/summary/CERF-LBN-24-RR-1426"">US $10 million in a Rapid Response allocation to provide immediate</a> help to people affected. This money is providing urgent food assistance, protection and shelter, safe water, and emergency health care for Umm Hassan, and thousands like her.</p>



<p><em>Shelter, sanitation and basic supplies</em></p>



<p>The Rapid Response allocation helped UNHCR provide people with essential supplies and critical information.</p>



<p>Thanks to CERF funding UNHCR is working with local partners like the Red Crescent to distribute critical supplies - blankets, cooking supplies, warm clothes - to people on the move, both within Lebanon and <a href=""https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/lebanese-and-syrians-suffer-loss-and-displacement-amid-surging-attacks"">on the borders with Syria</a>, where thousands fled.</p>



<p>Funding from CERF and other donors has allowed UNICEF to respond to water and sanitation needs in displacement sites, and to scale up education and child protection activities - giving children a bit of normality in a terrifying situation. For example, UNICEF and Red Cross Lebanon helped make sure <a href=""https://x.com/UNICEFLebanon/status/1840069678292762834"">displaced families in Zahle and Beirut had drinking water, mattresses, sleeping bags, hygiene and baby kits with diapers and wipes.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people continue to live in uncertainty.</p>



<p>“Half of my house was destroyed. We hope that one day we can rebuild and go back,” says Umm Hassan, who, like thousands of others, is just hoping for a return to safety.</p>

<p>Venezuela | 2024 | CERF</p>



<p>Venezuela, El Rincón. “Fishing is for men,” is the saying around these parts. In remote communities like this one in Sucre state, ensuring people have enough quality, nutritious food can be a challenge. Fish are a great source of nutrition, but social norms and lack of skills have made fishing an untapped source of food and work for many women.</p>



<p>Venezuela’s severe economic crisis, affecting over seven million people, has highlighted the need for innovative livelihood programmes that help improve food security.</p>



<p>The Central Emergency Response Fund allocated US $8.2 million under the Underfunded Emergencies programme, aiming to help families hit by the economic disruption and struggling to feed their families.</p>



<p><em>New skills to expand opportunities</em></p>



<p>The World Food Programme and partners are implementing a livelihoods programme in Sucre to help women expand their opportunities for work – ranging from baking and pastry making to fishing.</p>



<p>Participants received food baskets with rice, pasta, beans, and flour to support their families during the training period, allowing them to focus on learning new skills. In El Rincón, the group of mostly younger women embraced learning about the fishing trade, and challenging long-held stereotypes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For three months, the group met several times a week in a local school to practice fishing skills, fish preservation, boat repair, and financial management. “We realized this is not just for men, we can do it too,” said one young woman. “I’m thinking of starting a business selling the food the sea provides,” she added.</p>



<p><em>Trying new things</em></p>



<p>In other towns, women learned baking and pastry making. At a local gastronomy school, the project supported a three-month class that offered cake making skills and the business management skills that could help them run a sustainable business.</p>



<p>Asked how they picture ‘an entrepreneurial woman’, many answered that they now picture themselves - alongside their mother and grandmothers, who always found solutions to every day challenges.</p>



<p>The next phase of the project will involve families with children living with disabilities, aiming to provide them with tailored livelihoods skills to help address their particular needs.</p>

<p>Yemen |2024|CERF</p>



<p><strong>Yemen, Hudaydah governorate. </strong>Dr. Jamal Al Babeli is a young doctor at Bajil Hospital, working on the front lines of a growing health crisis.</p>



<p>Over eight years into the conflict, families in Yemen struggle to keep their children safe from war and also from hunger and disease, as poverty worsens under the continuing crisis. The health system is vastly under-resourced, making it hard for people to access quality care.</p>



<p>The governorates of Hajjah, Hudaydah and Taiz are among the worst affected, by food insecurity and by acute malnutrition. In a vicious cycle this is made even worse by the lack of access people have to quality primary health care.</p>



<p>Dr. Al Babeli is witnessing the country’s malnutrition crisis first hand. “We can’t stand by and do nothing,” he said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He works in the therapeutic feeding center, part of a network supported by the WHO with funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund. The center provides life- saving nutrition treatment, oxygen and safe water for sick children.</p>



<p>“Most people can’t afford treatment if they have to pay,” explains Dr. Al Babeli. “Thanks to collaboration with the World Health Organization and CERF, good quality treatment is free. This is saving lives.”</p>



<p>The cost of treatment isn't the only challenge: getting to the clinic is also expensive for families with limited resources. With CERF funding, WHO is able to provide transport assistance, admission kits, and cover caregivers' travel costs, reducing their financial burden.</p>



<p>Dr. Al Babeli himself has benefited from on-the-job training, gaining specialized skills in the treatment of malnourished children. </p>



<p>“I have become more confident in my work,” he said. “Working at the clinic has given me a new set of skills and knowledge. I’m more passionate about my work, when I can save a malnourished child.”</p>

<p>Ethiopia | 2024 | CERF</p>



<p><strong>Ethiopia, Matema. </strong>Abdi, who is Ethiopian, went to Sudan for work nearly two decades ago. He and his wife made a decent living, saving what they could and sending money back home to Ethiopia to help the extended family.</p>



<p>The war in Sudan forced him to flee to Ethiopia for safety. It was never the plan. Abdi was forced to give money to armed men who raided his neighbourhood. When he was not able to give more, they shot him in the leg, leaving him bleeding on the floor while his wife was locked in another room.</p>



<p>When his neighbours came to help and get him to a hospital, he initially resisted having surgery. “I did not come and work for years in Sudan to go home amputated. If I lose a leg, it will have to be in Ethiopia,” he recalls thinking to himself.</p>



<p>Despite this hope, Abdi did have an initial operation in Sudan. He was unable to walk, though, when he returned to Ethiopia, arriving at the crowded Matema border crossing.</p>



<p>Funding from CERF and others helped IOM manage the Metema Migration Response Center at the border with Sudan. It means that vulnerable people like Abdi were not left stranded at the border and could immediately receive the help they needed to return home or relocate to another safe place.</p>



<p>Abdi was referred to Gonder General Hospital, where he was able to correct his surgery and get access to mobility aids so he could start walking.</p>



<p>CERF funding also helped WHO buy and distribute much-needed medical supplies and medicines – especially for malaria – at the entry points of Metema and Kurmuk, to prevent the spread of disease among people displaced by the conflict and facing dire hardship.</p>



<p>Ethiopia hosts over 942,000 refugees in 24 camps, making it the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa. </p>

<p><strong>Central African Republic, Baoro. </strong>Fadimatou is seven years old. Her family fled to Cameroon to escape persistent violence in their hometown.</p>



<p>Now, Fadimatou and her family are among the Central African refugees who have recently returned home, resolved to start again.</p>



<p>With limited resources and sporadic outbreaks of violence, life remains uncertain. But for Fadimatou and other children, going to school is a first step toward normalcy and a better future.</p>



<p>Like thousands of displaced children, Fadimatou’s education was disrupted by all the moving around.</p>



<p>She was just a toddler when her family left CAR. Upon their return, her parents enrolled her in school, but she often felt left out because she didn’t have the school supplies she needed.</p>



<p>“I didn’t have a bag or anything to write with, and sometimes I stayed home because I felt different,” she quietly says.</p>



<p>A Central African NGO, <em>Association des Humanitaires pour le Dévelopement</em> (AHD), with support from the CAR Humanitarian Fund, provided essential school kits to 1,805 children, including 847 girls and 958 boys, ensuring that vulnerable children, including Fadimatou could fully participate in their education.</p>



<p>The NGO also led awareness sessions with families whose children are out of school, to encourage their return to education.</p>



<p>For Fadimatou, the school supplies made a big difference.</p>



<p>“It makes me happy to have my own things to write with now,” Fadimatou says, smiling. “I feel safe at school and want to keep going. I hope other kids in my neighborhood can get the same help next year.”</p>
