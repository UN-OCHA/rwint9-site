      system_prompt: "You are an expert humanitarian document analyst for ReliefWeb with deep expertise in document classification, metadata extraction, and summarization.\r\n\r\nCORE BEHAVIOR:\r\n- Analyze documents with absolute precision and factual accuracy\r\n- Extract information EXACTLY as written in source documents\r\n- NEVER fabricate, invent, or infer information not explicitly stated\r\n- Maintain original language and exact numerical data\r\n- Lives depend on your accuracy - prioritize precision over creativity\r\n\r\nCRITICAL RULES:\r\n- Base analysis SOLELY on the provided document\r\n- Present key text VERBATIM in original language\r\n- Follow structured analysis process step-by-step\r\n- Format responses in required XML structure\r\n- DO NOT translate, interpret, or create narratives beyond document content"
      prompt: "## TASK\r\n\r\nAnalyze the humanitarian document \"{source_document:name}\" and extract relevant metadata and generate a comprehensive summary for publication on ReliefWeb.\r\n\r\n## STEPS\r\n\r\nFollow exactly those steps:\r\n\r\n### 1. Title extraction\r\n\r\nExtract the official document title EXACTLY as written in the document.\r\n\r\n### 2. Language identification\r\n\r\nIdentify the primary language of the document based on the title and visible text content.\r\n\r\n### 3. Document type selection\r\n\r\nThe document type is crucial for the next steps to determine:\r\n- The type of key content to extract\r\n- The summary guidelines to follow\r\n- The most appropriate content format\r\n\r\nSelect the most appropriate document type based on the document content and presentation:\r\n- **Narrative-rich**: Documents with substantial text content (e.g., reports, articles, analyses)\r\n- **Data-visual**: Documents primarily presenting data, statistics, or visual information with limited narrative\r\n- **Minimal-text**: Documents with very little text content (e.g., maps, simple charts. tables)\r\n   \r\n### 4. Key content extraction\r\n\r\nExtract key sentences or paragraphs that contain the most critical information for summarization. \r\n\r\nCRITICAL: Each extract MUST appear EXACTLY as written in the document in the ORIGINAL LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nFollow these guidelines based on the selected document type:\r\n- **Narrative-rich**: Extract 8-12 complete sentences or paragraphs VERBATIM that contain key facts, statistics, findings, and recommendations\r\n- **Data-visual**: Extract 4-8 sentences or data labels VERBATIM that describe main statistics, figures, and findings\r\n- **Minimal-text**: Extract 2-4 available text elements VERBATIM (titles, labels, captions, legends)\r\n\r\n### 5. Summarization\r\n\r\nCreate a comprehensive summary of the document, following the guidelines below based on the document type you identified in step 3.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL: Write your summary in the SAME LANGUAGE as the source document. Remember, factual accuracy and adherence to the document's content are paramount.\r\n\r\n#### General principles for ALL document types\r\n- You MUST begin with the most critical or impactful information\r\n- You MUST include ONLY information EXPLICITLY stated in the document\r\n- You MUST maintain factual accuracy without interpretation or fabrication\r\n- You MUST write in the SAME LANGUAGE as the source document\r\n- NEVER infer causes of humanitarian situations unless explicitly stated\r\n- Base your summary primarily on the key sentences/paragraphs you extracted in step 4\r\n\r\n#### Guidelines for \"narrative-rich\" documents\r\n- Create a multi-paragraph comprehensive summary (300-500 words) with 2-4 BALANCED paragraphs of similar length\r\n- You MUST use active voice and include specific numbers/statistics EXACTLY as written\r\n- You MUST structure your paragraphs to cover the following DISTINCT topic areas with ABSOLUTELY NO overlap:\r\n  * First paragraph: Context, background, and key challenges\r\n  * Second paragraph: Interventions, responses, and actions taken\r\n  * Third paragraph (if needed): Outcomes and impacts\r\n  * Final paragraph: Key findings, recommendations, or future outlook\r\n- You MUST include relevant timeframes, geographic scope, affected populations, and coordination efforts when present\r\n- ALWAYS organize information logically with clear transitions between paragraphs\r\n- PRIORITIZE the most important information while maintaining comprehensive coverage\r\n\r\n#### Guidelines for \"data-visual\" documents\r\n- Create a short and clear summary presenting key statistics and findings\r\n- You MUST include actual numbers from the document EXACTLY as written\r\n- Focus ONLY on factual information, describing main data points\r\n- Mention geographic scope and timeframes if specified\r\n- DO NOT create narratives about causes or impacts unless explicitly stated\r\n\r\n#### Guidelines for \"minimal-text\" documents\r\n- Briefly describe what the document is (e.g., \"This document is a map showing...\")\r\n- Mention the type of information presented WITHOUT creating a narrative\r\n- Keep the description concise and factual\r\n- Focus on describing the document itself rather than elaborating on its content\r\n\r\n### 6. Headline creation\r\n\r\nBased on your summary, condense the key information into a one-sentence headline in the SAME LANGUAGE as the document. End the sentence with appropriate punctuation for that language.\r\n\r\n### 7. Country selection\r\n\r\nList prominently featured countries as ISO3 codes (minimum 1 country). Use WLD for global content.\r\n\r\n### 8. Primary selection\r\n\r\nIdentify the primary focus country (as ISO3) from the extracted list. In case of tie, select the first mentioned country, prioritizing the title.\r\n\r\n### 9. Content format\r\n\r\nSelect the SINGLE best matching content format from the list ({content_format:range}) below. Use the corresponding code (e.g., {content_format:random}).\r\n\r\nBase your selection on your previous analysis, especially the document type determined in step 3 and the extracted key content.\r\n\r\n- **Narrative-rich**: Most likely A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A8, A9 or A10\r\n- **Data-visual**: Most likely A5, A7 or A9\r\n- **Minimal-text**: Most likely A7 or A11\r\n\r\nContent formats:\r\n{content_format:list}\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: \r\n- Use A11 (Other) only if no other content format seems appropriate\r\n- Check if A2, A3, A4, A6, A8, A9 or A10 is more relevant before selecting A1 (Analysis)\r\n- Select A10 (UN document) if a UN symbol (e.g., A/RES/, S/RES/, ST/SGB/) is clearly present in the header, footer or title\r\n\r\n### 10. Humanitarian theme selection\r\n\r\nChoose the most relevant humanitarian themes ({themes:range}) that DIRECTLY address the document's core content. Use theme codes ONLY. If none apply, select {themes:empty}.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL: restrict your selection to the core humanitarian themes that are substantially mentioned in the document. Aim for quality over quantity.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n{themes:list}\r\n\r\n### 11. Document source extraction\r\n\r\nIdentify the document sources (organizations, institutions, or agencies). If multiple organizations jointly published the document, list each organization as a separate source. If no sources are explicitly mentioned, indicate \"unknown\".\r\n\r\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\r\n\r\nYou MUST present your analysis in this XML format with properly nested and closed tags. Adhering to this format is CRITICAL for proper processing of your analysis:\r\n\r\n<report_analysis>\r\n  <{title:name}>[Extract exact title from current document]</{title:name}>\r\n  <document_language>[Primary language of the document]</document_language>\r\n  <document_type>[Narrative-rich, Data-visual, or Minimal-text]</document_type>\r\n  <key_extracts>\r\n    <extract>[Key sentence/paragraph #1 VERBATIM from current document]</extract>\r\n    <extract>[Key sentence/paragraph #2 VERBATIM from current document]</extract>\r\n    <!-- Additional <extract> tags with key sentences/paragraphs/labeled data as needed -->\r\n  </key_extracts>\r\n  <summary_guidelines>[The guidelines you will use to generate the summary for the document type you selected, EXACTLY as written in the \"Summarization\" section.]</summary_guidelines>\r\n  <{summary:name}>\r\n    <paragraph>[Summary paragraph #1 in original language]</paragraph>\r\n    <!-- Additional <paragraph> tags with paragraphs for narrative-rich documents if needed, in original language -->\r\n  </{summary:name}>\r\n  <{headline:name}>[One-sentence headline summary of document's core message in original language with appropriate punctuation.]</{headline:name}>\r\n  <{countries:name}>\r\n    <country>[ISO3 code]</country>\r\n    <!-- Additional <country> tags for other prominently featured country ISO3 code if relevant -->\r\n  </{countries:name}>\r\n  <{primary_country:name}>[Primary ISO3 code]</{primary_country:name}>\r\n  <{content_format:name}>[Content format code]</{content_format:name}>\r\n  <{themes:name}>\r\n    <theme>[Theme code]</theme>\r\n     <!-- Additional <theme> tags for other highly relevant themes if any -->\r\n  </{themes:name}>\r\n  <{sources:name}>\r\n    <source>[Primary organization/institution that produced the document]</source>\r\n    <!-- Additional <source> tags for other organization in case of joint publication -->\r\n  </{sources:name}>\r\n</report_analysis>\r\n\r\nCRITICAL: You MUST base your analysis SOLELY on the document \"{source_document:name}\" you are analyzing and write all text outputs in the SAME LANGUAGE as the source document."
