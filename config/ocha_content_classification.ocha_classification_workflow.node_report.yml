      prompt: "Your task is to analyze the humanitarian \"{source_document:name}\" document and summarize its key content and extract relevant metadata for publication on ReliefWeb. Your analysis will be conducted in eight steps and should be presented in a clear XML format.\r\n\r\nFor your analysis, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Extract the official title exactly as written in the document.\r\n2. Create a detailed, multi-paragraph narrative summary that comprehensively describes the humanitarian situation. Include context, current challenges, stakeholder actions, human stories, statistics, funding issues, and future outlook. Ensure each paragraph focuses on a distinct aspect, flowing logically from one to the next. Write in a clear, engaging style that conveys the gravity of the situation while maintaining readability. Follow the SUMMARY GUIDELINES section for detailed instructions.\r\n3. Select the main language of the document from the Languages list. Use the corresponding code (e.g., {language:random}).\r\n4. Extract prominently featured countries as ISO3 codes with a minimum of 1 country. If the content is global use WLD as ISO3 code for World.\r\n5. Determine which single country (as ISO3) from the extracted list is the primary focus of the document, even if multiple countries are mentioned.\r\n6. Select the single best matching content format from the list ({content_format:range}). Use the corresponding code (e.g., {content_format:random}). Base your choice on the document's primary purpose and content focus as defined in the descriptions.\r\n7. Select the fewest explicit humanitarian themes ({themes:range}) that directly address the document's core content. Use theme codes only (e.g., {themes:random}). Exclude marginal or implied relevance. Prioritize central topics; fewer is better.\r\n8. Select the fewest disaster types ({disaster_types:range}) that are central to the humanitarian situation described in the document. Use disaster type codes only (e.g., {disaster_types:random}). Only include disasters that are explicitly described as causing the humanitarian needs or directly triggering the response efforts documented. Exclude disasters mentioned only briefly or tangentially. Choose only those disaster types that are integral to understanding why humanitarian action is needed in this specific context. Fewer is better.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n{language}\r\n\r\nContent Formats:\r\n{content_format}\r\n\r\nHumanitarian Themes:\r\n{themes}\r\n\r\nDisaster Types:\r\n{disaster_types}\r\n\r\nPresent your analysis STRICTLY in this XML format:\r\n\r\n<report_analysis>\r\n  <title>...</title>\r\n  <{summary:name}>\r\n    <paragraph>...</paragraph>\r\n    <paragraph>...</paragraph>\r\n </{summary:name}>\r\n  <{language:name}>...</{language:name}>\r\n  <{countries:name}>\r\n    <country>...</country>\r\n  </{countries:name}>\r\n  <{primary_country:name}>...</{primary_country:name}>\r\n  <{content_format:name}>...</{content_format:name}>\r\n  <{themes:name}>\r\n    <theme>...</theme>\r\n  </{themes:name}>\r\n  <{disaster_types:name}>\r\n    <disaster_type>...</disaster_type>\r\n  </{disaster_types:name}>\r\n</report_analysis>\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n\r\n<report_analysis>\r\n  <title>Yemen-Somalia: Drought Response Situation Report #12 (February 2025)</title>\r\n  <summary>\r\n    <paragraph>A relentless drought gripping Yemen and Somalia has pushed 12.3 million people to the brink of starvation, with three consecutive failed rainy seasons wiping out harvests and killing 70% of livestock in worst-hit communities. In Somalia's Bay region, mothers like Fadumo Hassan report walking eight hours daily to fetch brackish water, while health workers document alarming cases of wasting among children under five—now exceeding emergency thresholds in nine governorates.</paragraph>\r\n    <paragraph>Humanitarian teams have established 132 emergency water points since January 2025, providing 450,000 people with life-saving access to clean water. WFP trucks deliver monthly rations to 4.2 million beneficiaries through perilous supply routes, though escalating fuel prices have slashed delivery capacities by 40%. \"Every convoy faces impossible choices,\" explains WFP Field Officer Amina Khalid. \"Do we prioritize remote villages losing entire herds, or urban centers where child malnutrition rates now reach 24%?\"</paragraph>\r\n    <paragraph>The crisis threatens to deepen as a $214 million funding gap forces cuts to school meal programs—a critical safety net for 650,000 children. In Yemen's Marib province, ongoing clashes block aid access to 17 districts where families survive on boiled leaves. Climate analysts warn current response plans lack drought-resistant infrastructure for 8 million people in high-risk zones, setting the stage for mass displacement should rains fail again in June.</paragraph>\r\n  </summary>\r\n  <language>A1</language>\r\n  <countries>\r\n    <country>YEM</country>\r\n    <country>SOM</country>\r\n  </countries>\r\n  <primary_country>SOM</primary_country>\r\n  <content_format>B11</content_format>\r\n  <themes>\r\n    <theme>C7</theme>\r\n    <theme>C5</theme>\r\n    <theme>C18</theme>\r\n  </themes>\r\n  <disaster_types>\r\n    <disaster_type>D11</disaster_type>\r\n  </disaster_types>\r\n</report_analysis>\r\n\r\nSUMMARY GUIDELINES:\r\n1. Start with the most critical information: Begin your summary with the most urgent or impactful details.\r\n2. Avoid introductory phrases: Do not start sentences with \"The article states,\" \"The document emphasizes,\" or similar phrases.\r\n3. Use active voice and engaging language: Present information directly and dynamically, using active voice to keep the reader engaged.\r\n4. Organize into clear, distinct paragraphs: Divide the summary into paragraphs, each focusing on a unique aspect of the topic without repeating information from other paragraphs.\r\n5. Ensure logical flow: Make sure each paragraph builds upon the previous one, creating a coherent narrative.\r\n6. Cover all key points: Ensure that the summary includes all important details from the original document.\r\n7. Use specific details and statistics with context: Incorporate specific numbers and examples to illustrate the scale and impact of the situation. Balance factual reporting with enough context to help readers understand why these facts matter.\r\n8. Include human stories and quotes: When relevant, use personal accounts or direct quotes to bring the situation to life.\r\n9. Address challenges and solutions: Discuss both the problems and any actions being taken or proposed to address them.\r\n10. Conclude with a clear call to action or future outlook: End the summary by highlighting what needs to be done next or what the future might hold.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\n1. Keep your summary concise while covering all key information from the document.\r\n2. Select only the most relevant themes and disaster types that are explicitly addressed in your summary.\r\n3. Use ONLY the XML structure provided with proper opening and closing tags.\r\n4. If no humanitarian themes apply, use: <themes></themes>. If no disaster types apply, use: <disaster_types></disaster_types>.\r\n5. Your entire response must be valid XML with no text outside the tags.\r\n6. DO NOT INVENT INFORMATION. LIVES MAY DEPEND ON ACCURACY.\r\n7. Before submitting, verify that: (a) All dates in the summary include years; (b) Each selected theme and disaster type appears in the summary; (c) All listed countries receive coverage; (d) The primary country is prominently featured."
