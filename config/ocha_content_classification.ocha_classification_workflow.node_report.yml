      prompt: "Your task is to analyze the humanitarian \"{source_document:name}\" document and summarize its key content and extract relevant metadata for publication on ReliefWeb. Your analysis will be conducted in eight steps and should be presented in a clear XML format.\r\n\r\nFor your analysis, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Extract the official title exactly as written in the document.\r\n2. Extract 2-3 representative text samples verbatim from different sections of the document. These should be direct quotes without any modification or translation.\r\n3. Create a comprehensive summary of the humanitarian situation described in the document. For documents with substantial narrative content, develop a multi-paragraph summary covering context, challenges, actions, human stories, statistics, and future outlook. For documents containing primarily non-narrative content (tables, charts, minimal text), provide a single brief paragraph describing what the document contains instead.\r\n4. Extract prominently featured countries as ISO3 codes with a minimum of 1 country. If the content is global use WLD as ISO3 code for World.\r\n5. Determine which single country (as ISO3) from the extracted list is the primary focus of the document, even if multiple countries are mentioned.\r\n6. Select the single best matching content format from the list ({content_format:range}). Use the corresponding code (e.g., {content_format:random}). Base your choice on the document's primary purpose and content focus as defined in the descriptions.\r\n7. Select the fewest explicit humanitarian themes ({themes:range}) that directly address the document's core content. Use theme codes only (e.g., {themes:random}). If no relevant themes were found, select {themes:empty}.\r\n8. Analyze your summary, and the list of disaster types ({disaster_types:range}). If a disaster type is explicitly mentioned in the summary as directly causing the humanitarian crisis or triggering the response efforts then select it using its code (e.g., {disaster_types:random}). If no relevant disaster types were found, select {disaster_types:empty}.\r\n\r\nContent Formats:\r\n{content_format:list}\r\n\r\nHumanitarian Themes:\r\n{themes:list}\r\n\r\nDisaster Types:\r\n{disaster_types:list}\r\n\r\nPresent your analysis STRICTLY in this XML format:\r\n\r\n<report_analysis>\r\n  <title>...</title>\r\n  <extracts>\r\n    <extract>...</extract>\r\n    <extract>...</extract>\r\n  </extracts>\r\n  <{summary:name}>\r\n    <paragraph>...</paragraph>\r\n    <paragraph>...</paragraph>\r\n  </{summary:name}>\r\n  <{countries:name}>\r\n    <country>...</country>\r\n  </{countries:name}>\r\n  <{primary_country:name}>...</{primary_country:name}>\r\n  <{content_format:name}>...</{content_format:name}>\r\n  <{themes:name}>\r\n    <theme>...</theme>\r\n  </{themes:name}>\r\n  <{disaster_types:name}>\r\n    <disaster_type>...</disaster_type>\r\n  </{disaster_types:name}>\r\n</report_analysis>\r\n\r\nExample output 1 (source document in English):\r\n\r\n<report_analysis>\r\n  <title>Yemen-Somalia: Drought Response Situation Report #12 (February 2025)</title>\r\n  <extracts>\r\n    <extract>\"The drought has affected over 12.3 million people across Yemen and Somalia, with critical water shortages reported in 47 districts.\"</extract>\r\n    <extract>\"WFP's emergency response teams have established water distribution points in Marib, though security concerns continue to hamper access.\"</extract>\r\n    <extract>\"According to the Ministry of Health, acute malnutrition rates among children under five have reached alarming levels in Bay region.\"</extract>\r\n  </extracts>\r\n  <summary>\r\n    <paragraph>A relentless drought gripping Yemen and Somalia has pushed 12.3 million people to the brink of starvation, with three consecutive failed rainy seasons wiping out harvests and killing 70% of livestock in worst-hit communities.

Start with the most critical information: Begin with the most urgent or impactful details.\r\n2. Use active voice and engaging language: Present information directly and dynamically.\r\n3. Organize content logically: For multi-paragraph summaries, ensure each paragraph focuses on a distinct aspect with logical flow between paragraphs.\r\n4. Include specific details and statistics: Incorporate numbers and examples with enough context to show their significance.\r\n5. Add human stories and quotes when relevant: Use personal accounts to illustrate the human impact.\r\n6. Address both challenges and solutions: Discuss problems and actions being taken.\r\n7. For documents with minimal narrative content: Provide a concise, factual description of what the document contains (e.g., \"Data table showing food distribution statistics across refugee camps in northern Uganda from January-March 2023.\").\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\n1. Keep your summary concise while covering all key information from the document.\r\n2. For documents with minimal narrative content: Provide a single paragraph with a factual description rather than creating a fictional narrative.\r\n3. The extracted text samples must be copied VERBATIM from the source document without modification or translation.\r\n4. Use ONLY the XML structure provided with proper opening and closing tags.\r\n5. Your entire response must be valid XML with no text outside the tags.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL: DO NOT INVENT INFORMATION. LIVES MAY DEPEND ON ACCURACY."
