description: 'All advertisements should include a registration deadline unless it is an "ongoing course". Advertisements immediately expire after the registration deadline has passed. Advertisements tagged with "Call for Papers" usually include a submission deadline in the body text, so they should not be ongoing ads. For Universities, any ads advertising degrees should not be ongoing ads and should have a deadline.'
